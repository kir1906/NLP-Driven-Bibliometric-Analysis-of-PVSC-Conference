0,Crystalline phase control of BiVO4thin films using RF sputtering,"A selective fabrication method for monoclinic-scheelite (m-s) BiVO4and tetragonal-zircon (t-z) BiVO4thin films using radio fRequency (RF) sputtering from a single target was developed. The kinetic energy of the sputtered atoms was controlled by varying the sputtering power to obtain BiVO4films with m-s and t-z crystalline phases. Although the band gap of the t-z BiVO4phase (3.0 eV) was larger than that of m-s BiVO4(2.5 eV), the deposited t-z BiVO4films showed a comparable photocurrent density (1.5 mA cm−2) at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (400 W Xe lamp). This was mainly because of the reduced sputtering damage in the t-z BiVO4crystal, which originated from the low sputtering power as well as the deep valence-band position in t-z BiVO4that enabled the efficient utilization of the photocarriers. This work provides insights into crystalline phase control using the particle kinetic energy in sputtering.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acbb85","Namiki Uezono, Jiaqi Liu, Sachin A.

1,Electrolyte potentials and impedance measurement of polymer electrolyte membrane CO2reduction electrolyzer,"In electrochemical CO2reduction reactors, polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) reactors, also known as zero-gap cells, have great potential for achieving significant CO2reduction. Because these cells have a thin reactor core with a thickness of several hundred micrometers, it is difficult to determine their internal voltage distribution. To determine the anode voltage, ohmic loss in the membrane, and cathode voltage in the PEM reactors, we set three reference electrodes in the reactor and investigated the voltage values obtained from each reference electrode. We demonstrated that the reference electrode in contact with the anion exchange membrane extending to the outside of the cell provides the most reliable voltage. The voltage measured by this reference, combined with the resistance of the exchange membrane obtained through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, provides a breakdown of the voltage inside the cell.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acbe06","Takeharu Murakami, Kei Morishita, Kazuki Koike, Katsushi Fujii, Satoshi Wada","['School of Science and Technology, Meiji University, Kawasaki Kanagawa, Japan', 'RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, Photonics Control Technology Team, Wako, Japan']",2023,"In electrochemical CO2reduction reactors, polymer electrolyte membrane reactors, also known as zero-gap cells, have great potential for achieving significant CO2reduction.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Meiji University', 'RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics']",0,"['(Meiji University, 0)', '(RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
2,Effects of impact ionization and Auger recombination on hot-carrier solar cells and hot-carrier photocatalysts,"We applied hot-carrier extraction to solar cells and photocatalysts used for artificial photosynthesis including water splitting and CO2reduction, and elucidated the differences between these two applications: hot-carrier solar cells (HC-SCs) and hot-carrier photocatalysts (HC-PCs) by detailed balance calculations. The hot-carrier effect in the photocatalysts is less significant than that in the solar cells, because of the larger bandgaps required for generating sufficiently high-energy carriers consumed for the reactions. On the other hand, impact ionization and Auger recombination (IA) improves the efficiency of the HC-PCs more notably, because the IA functions like photon upconverters and hence narrows the optimal bandgap. Furthermore, the IA improves the spectral robustness by eliminating the constraint of the particle-number conservation for both the HC-SCs and HC-PCs. These benefits of the IA are contrasting with the well-recognized fact that the IA only reduces the carrier number and consequently lowers the efficiency of the conventional counterparts.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acbebe","Yasuhiko Takeda, Shunsuke Sato, Takeshi Morikawa","['Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc, Nagakute, Japan']",2023,"The hot-carrier effect in the photocatalysts is less significant than that in the solar cells, because of the larger bandgaps required for generating sufficiently high-energy carriers consumed for the reactions.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc']",1,"['(Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
3,Effects of He ion and electron beam irradiation on a CdTe solar cell dosimeter in a substrate configuration,"In this work, the effects of He ion and electron beam irradiation on substrate-type CdTe solar cells that are suitable for the detection of alpha and beta radiation are investigated. He ion irradiation revealed that the induced current proportionally increased with the increase of He ion current and that it is possible to detect alpha radiation using a substrate-type CdTe solar cell dosimeter. Next, the electron irradiation effects were investigated. The induced current proportional to the electron flux was also observed, and the sensitivity depended on the electron energy. In addition, the degradation of a substrate-type CdTe solar cell dosimeter by electron beam irradiation was investigated. No significant degradation in short-circuit current was observed at the electron irradiation of 3×1016cm−2at 200 keV and 1×1016cm−2at 400 keV. This result suggests that the substrate-type CdTe solar cell dosimeter is sufficiently resistant to electron irradiation.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acbd92","Tamotsu Okamoto, Fumiya Furumaki, Eiku Sato, Ippei Isogai, Yuji Kurimoto, Yasuki Okuno, Mitsuru Imaizumi, Masafumi Akiyoshi, Takeshi Ohshima","['Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Kisarazu, Japan', 'Osaka Metropolitan University, Sakai, Japan', 'Institute for Integrated Radiation and Nuclear Science, Kyoto University, Kumatori, Japan', 'National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, Takasaki, Japan', 'Research and Development Directorate, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Tsukuba, Japan']",2023,"In this work, the effects of UV ion and electron beam irradiation on substrate-type Group VIII solar cells that are suitable for the detection of alpha and beta radiation are investigated.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['National Institute of Technology', 'Osaka Metropolitan University', 'Kyoto University', 'National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology', 'Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency']",2,"['(National Institute of Technology, 0)', '(Osaka Metropolitan University, 0)', '(Kyoto University, 0)', '(National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, 1)', '(Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
4,Intrinsic characteristics of Si solar cells coated with thick luminescence down-shifting sol–gel glass films,"We investigate the effects of several-hundred-micron thick luminescence down-shifting (LDS) films composed of sol–gel glass with Zn-based nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed on the characteristics of Si solar cells. Their internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) are successfully measured by separating the contributions of downshifted photons in measuring reflectance for 300–400 nm, wavelengths of incident photons absorbed by the NPs. We find that IQEs for this wavelength range are more enhanced by employing thicker LDS films, i.e. LDS films with higher optical densities. We also discuss the relationship between the number density of NPs in LDS films, their optical properties, and the IQEs of cells. We observe a discrepancy between the measured and calculated IQEs and note that this is the result of downshifted photons escaping across the sides of the LDS films.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acc03e","Yuki Idutsu, Keigo Awai, Jianbo Liang, Hisaaki Nishimura, DaeGwi Kim, Yong-Gu Shim, Naoteru Shigekawa","['Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan', 'Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Metropolitan University, Osaka, Japan']",2023,The internal quantum efficiencies of thin luminescence down-shifting films are enhanced by employing thicker films with higher optical densities.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Osaka City University', 'Osaka Metropolitan University']",0,"['(Osaka City University, 0)', '(Osaka Metropolitan University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy']"
5,Electronic structures and molecular dynamics of gadolinium-doped FAPbI3perovskite crystals,"The additive effect of a gadolinium ion into a formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite crystal on electronic structures and molecular dynamics was investigated for improving photovoltaic performance with stability. The electronic structures, band structure, partial density of state, and molecular dynamics were determined by first-principles calculation. The band distribution and charge transfer between the 5d orbital of the gadolinium atom, the 5p orbital of the iodine atom, and the 6p orbital of the lead atom promoted the carrier generation and diffusion related to short-circuit current density. The enthalpy and kinetic energy prompted stabilization of the gadolinium-doped crystal with a slight distortion of coordination structure, as compared with the decomposition of the FAPbI3crystal. Diffusion coefficients of iodine and lead ions in the FAPbI3crystal with defect were increased, predicting decomposition. The gadolinium-doped FAPbI3perovskite crystal has great potential for applications in photovoltaic devices by improving photovoltaic performance.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acbec0","Atsushi Suzuki, Takeo Oku","['The University of Shiga Prefecture, Hassaka Hikone, Japan']",2023,The additive effect of a gadolinium ion into a formamidinium lead iodide perovskite crystal on electronic structures and molecular dynamics was investigated for improving photovoltaic performance with stability.,[],[],"['perovskite crystal', 'fapbi3perovskite', 'perovskite', 'gadolinium-doped fapbi3perovskite']","['lead iodide', 'formamidinium lead', 'gadolinium ion', 'gadolinium', 'effect gadolinium', 'lead']",[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['The University of Shiga Prefecture'],0,"['(The University of Shiga Prefecture, 0)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
6,Orientation control of two-dimensional perovskite (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1(n= 2) thin films by thermal annealing,"It has been attempted to preferentially orientate Pb-I layers in two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite thin films (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)Pb2I7perpendicular to substrates only by thermal annealing after spin coating of a reagent solution for improvements in the energy-conversion-efficiency of solar cells. It is found from X-ray diffraction measurements that the ratio of diffraction intensity from the (202) plane to that from the (060) plane becomes larger in thermally annealed (50 °C–135 °C) samples. This indicates that the Pb-I layer tends to grow perpendicular to the surface of the substrate. In particular, the ratio has reached 8.2, which is larger compared with the ratio of 2.7 for the randomly oriented powder sample, for the sample prepared on SnO2substrates. Such (202) oriented films seem to contribute to improvements in the energy-conversion-efficiency of tandem-type solar cells utilizing the 2D perovskite thin films as an active layer of the top cell.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acbd59","Yuya Futamura, Fumiya Sano, Haruki Yasuda, Shoichiro Hino, Yasushi Sobajima, Norimitsu Yoshida","['Gifu University, Gifu, Japan']",2023,The ratio of diffraction intensity from the plane to that from the plane becomes larger in thermally annealed samples.,[],[],['perovskite'],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['Gifu University'],0,"['(Gifu University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
7,Effects of carrier-blocking barrier height on two-step photocurrent generation in dilute nitride intermediate band solar cells,"GaAs:N dilute nitride intermediate band solar cells (IBSCs) with different barrier heights for blocking electron transport from the intermediate band (IB) were prepared and the role of such an electron blocking layer (EBL) was investigated. It is found that the EBL effectively confines electrons in the IB states, and the two-step photocurrent generation process is strongly affected by its barrier height. A rate equation analysis well reproduced experimental observations of the applied voltage dependence of the two-step photocurrent generation process. It revealed that the electron extraction both from the conduction band and the IB through the EBL is governed by the thermionic emission process. To meet the requirements of an ideal IBSC, optimized device structures including the barrier height of the EBL have to be designed properly taking into account the material parameters and carrier dynamics under the actual operating condition.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acbf5e","Shuhei Yagi, Shun Numata, Yasushi Shoji, Yoshitaka Okada, Hiroyuki Yaguchi","['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan', 'Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saitama University, Saitama, Japan', 'Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Meguro, Japan']",2023,A dilute nitride intermediate band solar cell with different barrier heights for blocking electron transport from the intermediate band was prepared and the role of such an electron blocking layer was investigated.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['JP', 'JPN']","['None', 'JPN']","['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology', 'Saitama University', 'The University of Tokyo']",2,"['(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)', '(Saitama University, 0)', '(The University of Tokyo, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
8,CZTS solar cells on graphite without Mo-coated glass substrate,"The use of graphite substrates has been demonstrated in thin-film Cu2ZnSnS4(CZTS) solar cells and can serve as alternative electrodes for next-generation, thin-film solar cells. From the early stages of CZTS development, Mo-coated substrates composed of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), tin (Sn), and sulfur (S) have been employed for stability at high temperature. However, Mo has become a rare metal in recent years; correspondingly, there are potential risk of supply shortages and depletion problems. We focus herein on graphite as an electrode and substrate owing to its versatility and low cost. The CZTS precursor was prepared by radiofrequency sputtering. Subsequently, NaF was deposited using the E-B vapor deposition method to control the Na composition ratio. CZTS films were obtained by gas-phase sulfurization at 898 K for 1 h. CZTS solar cells with MgF2/Al/AZO/CdS/CZTS/graphite structure were prepared, and their characteristics were evaluated.J–Vmeasurement of the precursor with a 20 nm thick NaF yieldedη= 2.37%,Voc= 543 mV,Jsc= 10.7 mA cm−2, andFF= 40.8%.

9,Highly efficient color-control technique for building-integrated photovoltaics using optical dielectric thin film,"A color-control technique based on optical thin films on glass is investigated by means of numerical simulation and experiment, with a particular focus on building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications. We show that white-colored BIPV modules can be realized with a minimum optical loss by applying optical thin films that have multiple reflection peaks in a complementary color relationship, like the emission spectrum of white LEDs. The angular dependence of hue, which is an inherent drawback of optical thin film systems, is suppressed by modifying the design of the film to maintain the complementary color relationship of multiple reflection peaks. The simulated thin film design is confirmed by an experiment with a silicon solar cell, resulting in a white color and a low short-circuit current density loss (ΔJSC) of 5.9%. These results indicate that our approach is a promising way to realize fascinating colors and a high energy yield simultaneously in BIPV modules.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acc594","Leo Adachi, Genki Hanashi, Sou Kubota, Zhihao Xu, Hitoshi Sai, Michio Kondo, Hiroyuki Wada","['Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan']",2023,"A color-control technique based on optical thin films on glass is investigated by means of numerical simulation and experiment, with a particular focus on building-integrated photovoltaic applications.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Tokyo Institute of Technology', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology']",2,"['(Tokyo Institute of Technology, 0)', '(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
10,Constructing the composition ratio prediction model using machine learning for BaSi2thin films deposited by thermal evaporation,"A composition ratio prediction model for BaSi2thin films deposited by thermal evaporation was constructed using machine learning. BaSi2was prepared by thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber, and the composition ratio was measured by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results show that the composition ratio is affected by various experimental parameters. To consider these parameters, kernel ridge regression was performed with Si/Ba ratio as the objective variable, and with experimental parameters as explanatory variables. A good fitting result was obtained by kernel ridge regression. The next step was to select a kernel function. We evaluated four types of kernel functions, and confirmed that two of them, the polynomial kernel and the sigmoid kernel, have relatively high prediction accuracy. Then we investigated different combinations of explanatory variables and found the best combination with the highest generalization performance. From the above, a composition ratio prediction model with a mean absolute error of less than 0.2 was obtained.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acc7b0","Ryuto Ueda, Keisuke Arimoto, Junji Yamanaka, Kosuke O.

This molecule incorporates dithienonaphthobisthiadiazole as a core unit that is a two-dimensionallyπ-extended fused ring. As a result, we found a long exciton lifetime in YS3 films originating from reduced radiative and nonradiative transitions. This is partly because radiative deactivation is effectively suppressed because of the dipole-forbidden transition in H-aggregates and partly because rotational deactivation is effectively suppressed in the crystalline film state.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acc66b","Yuki Sato, Tsubasa Mikie, Hiroya Yamada, Itaru Osaka, Hideo Ohkita","['Department of Polymer Chemistry, Kyoto University, Katsura Kyoto, Japan', 'Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Hiroshima University, Higashi Hiroshima Hiroshima, Japan']",2023,A fused ring-conjugated molecule incorporates dithienonaphthobisthiadiazole as a core unit that is a two-dimensionally-extended fused ring.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Kyoto University', 'Hiroshima University']",0,"['(Kyoto University, 0)', '(Hiroshima University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
12,AlGaN as an electron transport layer for wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells,Perovskite solar cells are expected to be applied as photoreceivers for high-efficiency optical wireless power transfer for electric vehicles. The use of aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) as an electron transport layer (ETL) for wide-gap perovskite solar cells is hereby proposed in this paper. The electrical properties and energy-band alignment of AlGaN deposited by either hydride vapor phase epitaxy or metal-organic CVD are investigated. AlGaN shows a higher conduction band level than conventional ETL materials. Simulation of the performance of a perovskite solar cell with CH3NH3PbBr3as the absorbing layer and AlGaN as the ETL was performed using a solar-cell capacitance simulator. The results suggest that AlGaN increases the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell by improving the conduction band offset between the perovskite layer and the ETL.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acc2ca,"Atsushi Hombe, Shinya Saiki, Tetsuya Mori, Yuji Saito, Tsutomu Tanimoto","['Nissan Motor Co., Ltd, Yokosuka, Japan']",2023,The use of aluminum gallium nitride as an electron transport layer for wide-gap perovskite solar cells is proposed in this paper.,[],[],"['perovskite solar', 'wide-gap perovskite', 'perovskite']","['use aluminum', 'aluminum', 'aluminum gallium', 'gallium nitride', 'gallium']",[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Nissan Motor Co., Ltd']",1,"['(Nissan Motor Co., Ltd, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

CIGS solar cells deteriorated after high-energy proton irradiation with non-ionizing energy loss of 1×1016MeVneqcm−2, however, the CIGS solar cells could generate power after high-fluence irradiation. The ideality factors increased from 1.3 to 2.0, and series resistance increased, indicating that the concentration of recombination centers increased in CIGS layers. After heat-light annealing, the conversion efficiencies gradually recovered, and the recombination centers were confirmed to be partly passivated by annealing at 90 °C. The short-circuit currents for 10μm thick CIGS solar cells were recovered by dark annealing in the same manner as for 2μm thick CIGS solar cells.

We investigated the relationship between the implied open-circuit voltage (iVOC) and the photoluminescence (PL) intensity imaging of solar cell precursors before metallization. Based on the relationship obtained, the change of the iVOCbefore and after metallization on the TiOxwas evaluated quantitatively. The results showed that the iVOCpredicted by the PL measurement decreases by 23–104 mV after metal deposition and shows a good agreement with the measuredVOCin the finished solar cells. These results demonstrate that the iVOCevaluation by PL measurement provides a good prediction of theVOCafter metallization, which is useful in analyzing the passivation degradation induced by metallization.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acc813","Shohei Fukaya, Kazuhiro Gotoh, Takuya Matsui, Hitoshi Sai, Yasuyoshi Kurokawa, Noritaka Usami","['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan', 'Department of Materials Process Engineering, Nagoya University, Furo, Japan']",2023,The degradation of surface passivation performance by metallization is a challenge in realizing highly efficient crystalline Si solar cells that use novel carrier-selective contacts.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology', 'Nagoya University']",2,"['(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)', '(Nagoya University, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
19,Effect of post laser annealing on stacked structure of CZTS thin film solar cells,"Cu2ZnSnS4(CZTS) is an attractive material for thin film solar cells because all its constituents are Earth-abundant elements, and it's a direct transition semiconductor with a band gap energy of 1.5 eV that is suitable for absorbing solar light spectrum effectively. CZTS is generally formed by precursor formation followed by heat treatment at 500 °C–600 °C to enhance the growth of crystal grain. In this work, a novel CZTS crystal grain re-growth process using post-laser annealing was investigated. 445 nm wavelength laser irradiation was performed on the Al-doped ZnO/CdS/CZTS/Mo/substrate stacked structure. X-ray diffraction and scanning microscope showed the CZTS crystal grain enlargement. Solar cells were fabricated on those structures and the external quantum efficiency was found to be improved especially at 500–1000 nm wavelength light absorption. That resulted in a short circuit current improvement.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acc665","Yosuke Shimamune, Hiromichi Tamaki, Kazuo Jimbo","['National Institute of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan']",2023,This invention relates to a method for re-growth of SiGe crystal grain using post-laser annealing.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['National Institute of Technology'],0,"['(National Institute of Technology, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

The structural optimization, such as surface passivation of the perovskite layer and better light management techniques, improved power conversion efficiency (PCE). To our knowledge, this PCE is the best in 2T-tandem solar cells using CZ wafers. Towards industrialization, crucial issues with the 2T tandem solar cells with crystalline Si bottom cell are discussed. Four-terminal (4T) tandem solar cells are evaluated as an approach to avoid the crucial issues. Examining our base technologies which realize 22.2%-conversion efficiency perovskite single junction solar cell module and 26%-heterojunction back-contact solar cells, we clarified that the based technologies were ready to realize 30%-conversion efficiency 4T perovskite/heterojunction crystalline Si tandem solar cells with approximately quarter size of an industrial crystalline Si solar cell (∼64 cm2).https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acc593","Kenji Yamamoto, Ryota Mishima, Hisashi Uzu, Daisuke Adachi","['KANEKA Corporation, Settsu, Japan']",2023,"2-20-conversion efficiency of a two-terminal perovskite/crystalline Si heterojunction tandem solar cell using 145m thick industrial Czochralski Si wafer is obtained.

The mechanical cut with the (110) oriented cleaved edge markedly decreased the photo-induced effective minority carrier lifetimeτeffto 6.9×10−4s, which was 0.22 times the initial value of 3.2×10−3s, and which was maintained by the region 0.5 cm away from the edge. The present passivation treatment resulted in the reduction ofτeffto 0.43, withτeffvalues of 4.0×10−4s at the edge and 9.4×10−4s at 0.2 cm from the edge. The analysis with a simple model of carrier diffusion in the lateral direction resulted in the recombination velocity at the cut edge, which was initially higher than 2000 cm s−1, being decreased to 50 cm s−1by the present treatment, while the recombination velocity at the sample surface was increased from 8 (initial) to 46 cm s−1, probably due to the field-induced depletion effect.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acc666","Masahiko Hasumi, Toshiyuki Sameshima, Tomohisa Mizuno","['Graduate School of Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Koganei, Japan', 'Department of Science, Kanagawa University, Hiratsuka, Japan']",2023,The effective passivation of cut edges of n-type crystalline silicon by forming thin oxide layers achieved by heat treatment in liquid water at 90 C for 2 h followed by heating in an air atmosphere at 300 C for 1 h.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology', 'Kanagawa University']",0,"['(Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 0)', '(Kanagawa University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
22,Periodical evaluation of photovoltaic modules and diode parameter extraction method using multiple linear regression models,"The stability and performance of photovoltaic (PV) modules can be assessed by outdoor testing where external conditions such as illumination and module temperature are measured at regular time intervals along with the jV-curve of the module. However, the fluctuation and seasonal variation of external conditions can make it difficult to trace changes such as degradation in PV-module properties (at e.g. standard test conditions). This contribution demonstrates the use of multiple linear regressions (MLR) to overcome these difficulties. The data gathered over large periods is condensed into a set of few predictors, that reproduce the jV parameters at infrequently encountered conditions that are required for comparison. Furthermore, the parameters of a physical device model are calculated directly from MLR-predictors, validating our procedure two-fold, by applying the MLR-method to simulated data, replicating the original input parameters, and comparing monthly parameter averages between the MLR-method and a known parameter extraction method.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acc668","G.

We investigated the structural and electrical properties of the highly doped n-type poly-Si layers to optimize the ion implantation process. We also investigated the surface passivation quality of our TOPCon structure. An effective carrier lifetime of 2.01 ms and an implied open circuit voltage of 704 mV were obtained for our sample annealed at 950 °C.

The reliability and durability of the novel concept modules were investigated using damp-heat (DH) testing, thermal-cycle (TC) testing, and sequential testing including DH and TC testing. No large reduction in maximum power after DH testing for 2700 h or TC testing for 1000 cycles was found for unencapsulated modules, irrespective of cell-connection method, cell spacing, or the existence of intentional microcracks. However, because of thermomechanical stress, unstable contact between interconnector ribbons and busbar electrodes was found after TC testing.

Secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements revealed that the boron concentration at the p-a-Si:H surface is increased by employing the B2H6plasma treatment. Furthermore, specific contact resistance is decreased by about one-third after the B2H6plasma treatment. No degradation of passivation performance is induced by the B2H6plasma treatment. The power conversion efficiency of the SHJ solar cells with the B2H6plasma treatment is improved by the increase in fill factor (FF) due to decreased series resistance and increased shunt resistance. From numerical simulations, the upward band bending is enhanced at the heterointerface between transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and p-a-Si:H by the B2H6plasma treatment, which is responsible for the improved FF owing to facilitated tunneling holes from c-Si to p-a-Si:H layers and the TCO/p-a-Si:H heterointerface.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acc953","Kazuhiro Gotoh, Ryo Ozaki, Motoo Morimura, Aki Tanaka, Yoshiko Iseki, Kyotaro Nakamura, Kazuo Muramatsu, Yasuyoshi Kurokawa, Yoshio Ohshita, Noritaka Usami","['Department of Materials Process Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan', 'Department of Advanced Science and Technology, Toyota Technological Institute, Japan', 'Namics Corporation, Nigorikawa Niigata, Japan']",2023,A method for improving the power conversion efficiency of high-performance silicon heterojunction solar cells is disclosed.,[],[],[],[],"['silicon heterojunction', 'heterojunction', 'heterojunction solar']",[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Nagoya University', 'Toyota Technological Institute', 'Namics Corporation']",2,"['(Nagoya University, 0)', '(Toyota Technological Institute, 1)', '(Namics Corporation, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

In thin films obtained by sulfurization at 560 °C of the precursor with SLG/Mo/Sn/Cu/Au/NaF structures fabricated on Soda lime glass substrates containing alkali metals, a significant increase in the CTS grain size was observed in the Au deposition thickness range of 5–25 nm. By contrast, no crystal growth was observed in thin films with a precursor without an NaF layer fabricated using alkali-free glass (EAGLE XG), regardless of the thickness of the Au-deposited film. Therefore, appropriate amounts of Au and Na promote the crystal growth of CTS. In addition, at the sulfurization temperature of 570 °C, the crystal grains were larger than those of the thin film fabricated at 560 °C.

The PID of n-FE c-Si PV modules is known to occur in three stages under negative bias stress. The second-stage PID is characterized by a reduction in fill factor (FF), due to the invasion of sodium (Na) into the depletion region of a p+–n junction and the resulting increase in recombination current. The second-stage PID shows a curious independence from a negative bias voltage for the PID stress. This may indicate that the Na inducing the FF reduction comes not from the cover glass but originally existed on and/or near the cell surface. The FF reduction is recovered quite rapidly, within a few seconds, by applying a positive bias to the degraded cell. The recovered n-FE c-Si PV modules show more rapid degradation if they receive the negative bias stress again, which can be explained by Na remaining in the p+emitter.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/accb60","Keisuke Ohdaira, Yutaka Komatsu, Seira Yamaguchi, Atsushi Masuda","['Niigata University, Niigata, Japan', 'Institute of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan', 'Graduate School of Science and Technology, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan', 'Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Nomi, Japan']",2023,The second-stage potential-induced degradation of n-type front-emitter crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules is investigated.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Niigata University', 'University of Tsukuba', 'Niigata University', 'Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology']",0,"['(Niigata University, 0)', '(University of Tsukuba, 0)', '(Niigata University, 0)', '(Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

Lightning impulses with a voltage of −40 kV were applied to the module between the shorted electrodes of the c-Si cell and the mimic aluminum frame.

We have found that the PID of c-Si PV modules was accelerated by applying the impulses between a c-Si cell and a metal frame.

36,Fabrication of solar cells using Ge–Sn–S thin film prepared by co-evaporation,"In this study, we produced thin-film solar cells using co-evaporated Ge–Sn–S thin film as the light-absorbing layer. The thin films were prepared at different concentrations of Ge and substrate temperatures. We characterized the solar cells and compared their physical properties with those of an SnS thin film fabricated using only Sn and S. The GexSn1−xS (x= 0.27) thin film solar cell exhibited the best performance, with short circuit current densityJsc= 0.66 mA cm−2, curve factor FF = 0.324, power conversion efficiency PCE = 0.036%, and open circuit voltageVoc= 0.169 V.

TWEPC measurements reveal that photocurrent generation is significantly enhanced when above gap excitation and below gap excitation (BGE) sources are applied simultaneously. With increasing BGE photon energy, a large increase in photocurrent is observed. The external quantum efficiency measurements show that the effect of BGE light is higher with a higher density of tail states present. The extended numerical study by rate equations reproduced the results in a good manner.

Encapsulant-less modules were found to have high PID resistance compared to conventionally encapsulated c-Si PV modules in both PID conditions. We observed a slight PID for the encapsulant-less modules in which the cover glass was in contact with the solar cell. The slight PID can be suppressed by using a base with a deeper groove so that a sufficient gap between the cover glass and the cell is prepared. Yellow precipitates were formed in the encapsulant-less modules in the DH environment. This is probably due to the hydrolysis of the PC, and proper measures to prevent the precipitate formation should be applied for the industrialization of the encapsulant-less modules.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acc9ce","Shuntaro Shimpo, Huynh Thi Cam Tu, Keisuke Ohdaira","['Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Nomi, Japan']",2023,"The long-term durability of our newly developed encapsulant-less p-type crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules, with a base made of polycarbonate , against potential-induced degradation in dry and damp-heat environments is investigated.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology'],0,"['(Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
39,Ultrathin Al-doped SiOxpassivating hole-selective contacts formed by a simple wet process,"Ultrathin Al-doped Si oxide (SiOx) layers were formed by a simple wet chemical treatment, and their hole-selective passivating contact and electrical properties were investigated. From the evaluated contact resistivity (ρc) and saturation current density (J0), carrier selectivity (S10) was estimated to be 13.3. Moreover, in Si nitride (SiNy)/Al-doped SiOxstacks, negative values of fixed charge density (Qf) were obtained, despite a high positiveQfexisting in the single SiNylayer. This result implies that Al-doped SiOxhas high negative fixed charges and overcompensates the charge polarity in the stacks, which forms an inversion layer and accumulates holes on the Si surface. Furthermore, the negative fixed charges realize excellent carrier separation by the induced upward band bending.

The gas ambient during annealing was changed to investigate the effect on SiGe layer quality and physical properties. The SiGe formed samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Oxygen-containing atmosphere suppressed the SiGe layer formation by oxidizing the Al particle surface, limiting the reaction of the particle to the Si surface.

Modules of amorphous Si with a glass–glass structure and those of crystalline Si with glass and a back-sheet structure were subjected to hygrothermal stresses by a damp-heat (DH) test and high-voltage stress by a potential-induced degradation (PID) test, respectively. Even after a quite long DH test at 85 °C and 85% relative humidity for 49 000 h, retention of output power of about 85% was obtained without edge sealant. No decrease in output power was also observed after a PID test with −1000 V at 60 °C and 85% relative humidity for 168 h.

The drift-diffusion simulator for IBSC simulation was constructed by using the semiconductor module and wave optics module of COMSOL MultiPhysics®. The deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm was chosen as the learning algorithm to optimize the specified device structure. A GaAs quantum well-embeddedIBSC was used as the test candidate to verify the performance of the DDPG-based inverse design approach. A maximum efficiency ofwas reached for the device with optimal structure parameters searched by the DDPG agent, which exceeds the target efficiency of 30%. The subsequent optical analysis revealed that the electric field enhancement due to light absorption at the IB region with a wavelength between 450 nm and 600 nm is mainly contributing to the significantly increased short-circuit current for the optimized device. Meanwhile, a parameters correlation with target conversion efficiency evaluated by topological data analysis successfully identified all the positive and negative parameters with respect to the target parameter, indicating the physical soundness of the optimized structure parameters. Our work presented here demonstrates that a well-trained AI agent can fulfill the target efficiency by searching the optimal parameters for solar cell devices.

50,Effect of sulfur doping on the photocatalytic performance of sputtered BiVO4thin films,"BiVO4thin films doped with various concentrations of sulfur were fabricated using RF sputtering followed by post-deposition sulfurization. The incorporation of sulfur in the samples was calculated to be approximately 8–11 at% from the S2s peak in their X-ray photoelectron spectra. The optical bandgap of sulfur-doped BiVO4was generally smaller than that of the undoped sample. BiVO4films doped with ∼8 at% sulfur showed the highest photoelectrochemical performance compared to the undoped sample. Almost similar minority-carrier lifetimes in undoped and low sulfur-doped BiVO4, measured by time resolve photoluminescence, suggest that the crystal qualities in terms of the recombination properties are roughly the same for both cases. Thus, although further investigation may be necessary, the improved photocurrent in 8 at% sulfur-doped BiVO4in our study can roughly be attributed to the decrease in the bandgap, which facilitates more photoexcited carriers to contribute to the photoelectrochemical reaction. A further increase in sulfur doping above 10 at% distorted the BiVO4local crystal structure, inducing defects, thus resulting in a lower photocurrent.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acd45c","Shukur Gofurov, Namiki Uezono, Lingga Ghufira Oktariza, Jiaqi Liu, Sachin Pawar, Muhammad M.

52,A modeling framework to quantify the intermediate layer impact in III–V//Si multijunction solar cells,"Multijunction solar cells (MJSCs) are capable of converting sunlight to electricity more efficiently than single-junction solar cells. The intermediate scattering layers between the individual junctions contribute to high efficiency by impacting the generated currents, photon recycling (PR), as well as luminescent coupling (LC) in the device. The MJSC efficiency can be simulated using expressions that involve a simplified and idealized intermediate layer structure but cannot accurately reflect its actual performance. This work, however, aims to establish a systematic optical model for MJSCs with complicated intermediate layers.

In devices without MeO-2PACz, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) above 450 nm increases with the increase in NiOxthickness from 4 to 53 nm, although even in the thickest case, the IQE never reaches 90%. On the other hand, devices with MeO-2PACz modified NiOxshow thickness-insensitive IQE of ca. 90%. We propose that (1) MeO-2PACz effectively fills the pinholes in thinner NiOxand (2) it passivates the carrier trapping/recombination defects at the NiOx/perovskite interface.https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/acd5dc","Masatoshi Yanagida, Tensho Nakamura, Tsukasa Yoshida, Dhruba B.

55,Optimization of numerical weather model parameterizations for solar irradiance prediction in the tropics,"Many photovoltaic (PV) systems are connected to electrical power grids, and the grids are at risk of instability due to fluctuation of PV output. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are used to forecast solar irradiance and proper grid management. NWP usually has many physical parameterization options, and appropriate schemes of these options should be selected for accurate forecasting. The options should be determined by regional and climatic conditions and other factors. The target country is Thailand, which is in the tropics. In Thailand, cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds frequently appear, and their behavior makes weather forecasting difficult. The optimal combination of schemes in the tropics is determined through a sensitivity analysis of the options. By the optimization the forecasting accuracy increases from 0.773 to 0.814 of the correlation coefficient.

Herein, an efficient approach used for the rational synthesis of an effective ORR electrocatalyst by encapsulating Pt nanoparticles with ultra-low content (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 wt.% Pt) on the surface of a copper-based organic metal frame (Cu-MOF-74) and then carbonized at 900 °C, for the first time. The catalyst Pt1%/Cu/NC-900 from the series of prepared catalysts exhibits a highly efficient ORR activity with an onset potential (Eo) 1.01 V vs RHE and half-wave potential (E1/2) 0.88 V vs RHE compare to commercial Pt/C (Eo0.96 V and E1/20.86 V vs RHE). It has also displayed excellent long-term stability in an alkaline solution. The Pt1%/Cu/NC-900 performance and stability are dramatically improved, which may be attributed to the interaction of Pt with Cu and carbon carriers. Such an architecture provides an efficient approach for direct application of MOFs to electrocatalysts.

Earlier, the authors analysed the amorphous, mono- and poly-crystalline silicon solar cells with varying underwater conditions (Enaganti 2020). The findings indicated that SPV has a wide potential to utilize in underwater conditions for diverse applications. This has motivated us to explore the behaviour of solar cells underwater considering other parameters, like solar spectral range, as well. Evidently, the solar spectral range gets narrower and the solar radiation gets reduced in underwater conditions with an increasing in water depths. Herein, the performance of mono- and poly-crystalline silicon solar cells has been investigated underwater with varying regions of the spectral ranges from the Standard AM 1.5 solar simulator using optical colour glass filters. The obtained results manifest that even with the limited spectral ranges, mono- and polycrystalline solar cells showed 44.8% and 39.34% decrease in the maximum power output respectively at 20 cm water depth using band pass filter.

The texturization obtained by the HF/HCl/H2O/MnO2system had a more uniform distribution and a lower surface reflectance than that obtained by the conventional HF/HNO3/H2O system, especially on the surface of diamond wire sawn (DWS) mc-Si wafers. The etching mechanism was revealed by studying the effects of the usage variation of HF, HCl and MnO2. The etching only occurs at the locations where MnO2particles are deposited on the silicon surface and will self-terminate with the full consumption of MnO2. Thus the texture morphology can be easily controlled by adjusting the usage of MnO2particles with sufficient HCl and HF.

64,Review—Electrochemistry for Sustainable Solar Photovoltaics,"Electrochemistry and solar photovoltaics are traditionally considered to be in two different domains of science and technology. However, electrochemistry will play an indispensable role in sustaining the production and deployment of solar panels in the coming decades. This paper presents three examples on how electrochemistry will lead to solutions to several roadblocks to sustainable solar photovoltaics. The first example is storage of intermittent solar electricity through a zinc↔zinc oxide loop which requires two technologies: (1) solar electroreduction of zinc oxide and (2) a mechanically-recharged zinc/air battery. Compared to the hydrogen↔water loop, the zinc↔zinc oxide loop is advantageous for long-term (seasonal to multiyear) storage and global trade of solar electricity. The second example is electrorefining to produce solar-grade silicon from metallurgical-grade silicon. Ultrapure materials by electrolysis is an unanswered challenge in electrochemistry. A two-step three-electrode electrorefining process is proposed. Practical challenges in achieving ultrapure silicon by molten-salt electrorefining are outlined. The final example is metal recovery from waste solar panels. Four metals in silicon panels are worth recovery: silver, lead, tin, and copper. They can be leached out in nitric acid and the leachate contains multiple metals. Sequential electrowinning can recover the metals one by one based on their different reduction potentials. The remaining issues in this process are discussed.https://doi.org/10.1149/2162-8777/abd376",,"['School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, United States of America']",2020,The paper presents three examples on how electrochemistry will lead to solutions to several roadblocks to sustainable solar photovoltaics.,[],[],[],"['lead solutions', 'electrochemistry lead', 'lead']",[],[],[],['US'],['USA'],['Arizona State University'],0,"['(Arizona State University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
65,Review—Research Needs for Photovoltaics in the 21st Century,"By 2050, the scale of installed solar panels must reach about 100 TWp in order to make a tangible impact on our energy mix and carbon emissions. Thin-film amorphous silicon panels are the only technology today capable of 100 TWp installation. Wafer silicon panels could reach 100 TWp if the silver in silicon panels is replaced with copper or aluminum. Cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium selenide would become technologies of insignificance in the big picture. For energy-efficient production of silicon panels, research is needed in energy-efficient purification of silicon, low kerf loss wafering of silicon, and an Earth-abundant top cell on silicon. Alternatively we can pursue a new cell technology which is more energy efficient than silicon and utilizes only Earth-abundant materials. For any cell technology, research is needed to improve the cost, efficiency, and sustainability including storage technologies for daily to multiyear storage and for regional and global trade of solar electricity, recycling technologies to minimize cost and maximize revenue from waste panels, and systems and applications for real-time and in situ consumption of solar electricity.https://doi.org/10.1149/2162-8777/abd377",,"['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, United States of America', 'Conn Center for Renewable Energy Research, University of Louisville, Louisville, United States of America', 'School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, United States of America', 'Department of Energy & Materials Engineering, Dongguk University, Junggu, Republic of Korea', 'Department of Electric and Electronic Engineering, Kindai University, Higahiosaka, Japan']",2020,The scale of installed solar panels must reach about 100 MHzp in order to make a tangible impact on our energy mix and carbon emissions.,[],[],[],"['mix carbon', 'carbon', 'carbon emissions']",[],[],[],"['JP', 'KR', 'US']","['KOR', 'USA', 'JPN']","['University of Texas at Arlington', 'University of Louisville', 'Arizona State University', 'Dongguk University', 'Kindai University']",0,"['(University of Texas at Arlington, 0)', '(University of Louisville, 0)', '(Arizona State University, 0)', '(Dongguk University, 0)', '(Kindai University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
66,Reliability of PERC Solar Cells under Alpha Irradiation: A Simulation-Based Study for Space Applications,"The effects of alpha particles' irradiation on the performance of simplified PERC silicon solar cells are studied through technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulations. The methodology adopted in this work incorporates the non-ionizing energy loss (NIEL) phenomenon to understand the radiation effects, which does not depend on extensive irradiation experimentations. Simulation results show that alpha particles in the range of ∼10 MeV and with fluence >1014cm−2lead to maximum performance degradation of the solar cell. Moreover, it is found that upon irradiating the solar cell with 1 MeV alpha particles, the output power reduces proportionally with increasing fluence due to the reduction of minority carrier lifetime in the base. On the other hand, the fill factor (FF) degrades by only <10% up to a fluence of ∼1013cm−2, after which it decreases sharply. This trend reveals that the FF deteriorates significantly only when the irradiation process creates a Frenkel pair density that approaches the majority carrier density in the base. The methodology presented in this work opens new research avenues for potentially optimizing the solar cell design not only for better efficiency but also for improved reliability in radiation rich environments.https://doi.org/10.1149/2162-8777/abdadf",,"['a', 'k', 't', 'y', 'l', 's', ',', 'Q', 'z', ' ', '-', 'n', 'm', 'r', 'A', 'P', 'u', 'd', 'v', 'e', 'b', 'I', 'i', 'U']",2021,The effects of alpha particles irradiation on the performance of simplified AC silicon solar cells are studied through technology computer aided design simulations.,[],[],[],[],[],"['perc solar', 'perc']",[],[],[],"['niversity of California, Los Angeles (University', 'niversity of California, San Diego (University']",0,"['University of California, Los Angeles (University, 0)', 'University of California, San Diego (University, 0)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy', 'Performance of Solar Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
67,An Investigation of the Recovery of Silicon Photovoltaic Cells by Application of an Organic Solvent Method,"The treatment of photovoltaic (PV) waste is gaining traction the world over, with the recovery of valuable materials fromend-of-life, or damaged andout-of-specpolycrystalline silicon PV modules. These materials are a focus of recycling. However, the current recycling practices usually involve excessive damage to PV cells that could otherwise be reused if recovered undamaged. The ability to recover undamaged PV cells, capable of reuse, would serve to further reduce the carbon footprint and cost associated with PV module manufacturing. This study focuses on the recovery of silicon PV cells fromend-of-lifePV modules by application of an organic solvent method. Herein, recovery tests were carried out in which silicon PV cells were recovered with minimal damage with the application of hexane as solvent. X-ray diffraction and UV–vis spectrophotometry measurements were conducted post recovery of the PV cells.

Conditions for removal of laser damage and contamination on the laser-patterned surface are identified. The effect of plating temperature and post-annealing temperature on Al morphology and resistivity are investigated. Several plating additives are explored to improve the morphology and resistivity of the Al film. Nicotinic acid produces the lowest resistivity of 3.1μΩ-cm. However, the lowest contact resistivity between light-induced Al and Si is 69 mΩ-cm2due to laser-induced damage to the emitter.

69,Binary Redox Couples for Highly Transparent and High-Voltage Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells,"The conventional iodine-based (I−/I3−) electrolyte used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) presents several limitations, such as ∼30% absorption of visible light in the wavelength range of 300–500 nm and a large potential difference between the Fermi level of I−/I3−and the HOMO level of the dye. This has a negative impact on the characteristics of DSSC such as transparency and open circuit voltage (Voc). In the present work, a series of transparent electrolytes are prepared using various additives such as I2, LiI, guanidine thiocyanate/guanidine nitrate (GuSCN/GuNO3), and Br2to obtain highly transparent and high voltage DSSCs. The results demonstrate that the usage of the optimized electrolyte consisting of 0.003 M Br2, 0.01 M LiI, and 0.1 M GuNO3, with the binary redox couple (I−, Br−)/(I3−, I2Br−), contributes to an ∼25% increase in transmittance compared to that of the conventional electrolyte, while the concentration of I3−is significantly reduced. Furthermore, the downward shift in the Fermi level of the binary redox system is shown to provide an ∼100 mV enhancement in the Vocof the DSSC compared with that of the conventional electrolyte based DSSC. In addition, the devices with the optimized binary redox system achieve a power conversion efficiency of ∼7.94% which is closely comparable to the performance of conventional (I−/I3−) electrolyte-based DSSCs. Thus, the present study could provide immense insights toward the fabrication of high-voltage and transparent DSSCs for the application in transparent photovoltaic windows. Furthermore, by using a binary redox electrolyte, the DSSCs that operative under a 2000 lux compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) were also successfully fabricated and yielded a promising efficiency of 23.6%.https://doi.org/10.1149/2162-8777/abe2f9",,"['Department of Energy & Materials Engineering and Research Center for Photoenergy Harvesting & Conversion Technology (phct), Dongguk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea']",2021,A series of transparent electrolytes are prepared using various additives such as guanidine thiocyanate/guanidine nitrate to obtain highly transparent and high voltage dye-sensitized solar cells.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['KR'],['KOR'],['Dongguk University'],0,"['(Dongguk University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Performance of Solar Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
70,Present status and future perspectives of bifacial PERC+ solar cells and modules,"This paper reviews the main research results related to PERC+ silicon solar cells. Compared to today's industry typical passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) silicon solar cells with full-area rear aluminum layer, PERC+ solar cells apply an aluminum finger grid on the rear side and hence are able to absorb diffuse light from the rear side in addition to the direct sunlight which is absorbed from the front side. This bifaciality increases the energy yield of silicon solar modules by up to 25%. Since its first publication in 2015, the PERC+ cell concept has been rapidly adopted by several solar cell manufacturers due to the very similar process technology of bifacial PERC+ cells and main stream monofacial PERC cells. We summarize technological challenges, published PERC+ conversion efficiencies and PERC+ module technologies. First energy yield data of PERC+ field installations demonstrate the high energy yield potential of PERC+ solar cells.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RA01","Thorsten Dullweber, Henning Schulte-Huxel, Susanne Blankemeyer, Helge Hannebauer, Sabrina Schimanke, Ulrike Baumann, Robert Witteck, Robby Peibst, Marc Köntges, Rolf Brendel","['Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH), Emmerthal, Germany', 'Meyer Burger Technology AG, Gwatt (Thun, Switzerland']",2018,A bifacial silicon solar cell with an aluminum finger grid on the rear side and hence are able to absorb diffuse light from the rear side in addition to the direct sunlight which is absorbed from the front side.,[],[],[],"['aluminum', 'aluminum finger']",[],"['perc solar', 'bifacial perc', 'perc']",[],"['DE', 'CH']","['DEU', 'CHE']","['Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin', 'Meyer Burger Technology AG']",1,"['(Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin, 1)', '(Meyer Burger Technology AG, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
71,Evaluation of oxygen precipitation behavior in n-type Czochralski-Si for photovoltaic by infrared tomography: Effects of carbon concentration and annealing process conditions,"In this study, we evaluated the effects of carbon and annealing process conditions on the oxygen precipitation in an n-type Czochralski (Cz) wafer for solar cells by infrared light scattering tomography (IR-LST). It was confirmed that precipitates grow larger and denser as carbon concentration increase. Thus, carbon promotes oxygen precipitation. We also evaluated the effect of oxygen precipitation on the minority carrier lifetime by photoluminescence (PL) imaging. It was confirmed that the interface between the precipitate and the Si matrix is a dominant recombination center since the surface area of the precipitate obtained by IR-LST measurement and the PL intensity show good correlation. In addition, it was also confirmed that carbon is involved in the supply of interstitial oxygen to precipitates through the formation and extinction of the thermal donor. We believe that it is important to understand and control the effect of carbon of controlling the oxygen precipitation behavior.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RB01","Kosuke Kinoshita, Takuto Kojima, Hiroto Kobayashi, Yoshio Ohshita, Atsushi Ogura","['Toyota Technological Institute, Nagoya, Japan', 'School of Science and Technology, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Japan']",2018,"In this study, we evaluated the effects of carbon and annealing process conditions on the oxygen precipitation in an n-type Czochralski wafer for solar cells by infrared light scattering tomography .",[],[],[],"['oxygen', 'carbon', 'carbon concentration', 'carbon annealing', 'oxygen precipitation', 'effects carbon', 'conditions oxygen']",[],[],[],"['JP', 'JPN']","['None', 'JPN']","['Toyota Technological Institute', 'Meiji University']",2,"['(Toyota Technological Institute, 1)', '(Meiji University, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
72,Improved hot-zone for manufacturing low-oxygen silicon ingots for passivated emitter and rear cell,"In the silicon wafers, interstitial oxygen and vacancies make oxygen precipitation in the cell process. The oxygen precipitates become combination centers for minority carriers, and it is resulted in decrease of minority carrier life-time (MCLT) and cell efficiency. In order to grow ingots with low oxygen concentration, we locally optimized hot-zone in the ingot grower. We have designed new hot-zone for commercial 8.3-in. diameter ingot growth using 24-in. quartz crucible and old grower. The average oxygen reduction is about 3 ppma at the top position of ingot, which is similar to the simulation result of oxygen distribution. Despite the inside temperature of grower rises, the concentration of oxygen was suppressed to 15 ppma or less as in a normal heater. As a result, it is possible to grow a low-oxygen ingot that can suppress the light induced degradation (LID), which can fundamentally help improve the efficiency of a high efficiency passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC).https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RB02","Sungsun Baik, Ah Jeong, Ji Min Kang, Youngsik Hahn, Woo-Joon Nam, Wooseok Nam","['Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea', 'Chungbuk Technopark, Jinchun, Korea', 'Woongjin Energy Co., Ltd, Daejeon, Korea']",2018,"In order to grow ingots with low oxygen concentration, we locally optimized hot-zone in the ingot grower.",[],[],[],"['oxygen', 'low oxygen', 'oxygen concentration']",[],[],[],['KR'],['KOR'],"['Konkuk University', 'Chungbuk Technopark', 'Woongjin Energy Co., Ltd']",2,"['(Konkuk University, 0)', '(Chungbuk Technopark, 1)', '(Woongjin Energy Co., Ltd, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
73,Passivation effect of ultra-thin SiNxfilms formed by catalytic chemical vapor deposition for crystalline silicon surface,"We propose a way of replacing silicon dioxide (SiO2) films in tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells by ultra-thin Si nitride (SiNx) films. We deposit SiNxfilms on n-type crystalline Si (c-Si) wafers by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (Cat-CVD), by which we avoid a plasma damage to the surface of c-Si. Thin (<5 nm) SiNxfilms can be deposited with good controllability by tuning the deposition conditions. To improve the passivation quality of SiNxfilms, hydrogen treatment was performed onto the SiNx-coated c-Si surfaces. Their effective minority carrier lifetime (τeff) can be improved up to >1 ms by the hydrogen treatment for the samples containing SiNxwith a proper refractive indices and >10-nm-thick n-type amorphous Si (n-a-Si).

While almost no difference was found in the fracture stress of the thick (200 µm) wafers cut from either side, the thin (120 µm) wafers showed a lower fracture stress in those from the fresh-wire side compared to the worn-wire side. This is a remarkable result when wafers are sawn with conventional diamond wire. On the contrary, wafers sawn with improved diamond wire (100d-M6/12) showed a higher fracture stress compared to those cut with conventional diamond wire (100d-M8/16), for both the fresh- and worn-wire sides. Observing the subsurface areas of wafers by micro-Raman spectroscopy, we succeeded in quantifying the defective silicon fraction as the Raman crystallinity factor (Φc).

The best cell efficiency was 20.4%, and the average efficiency was 20.06%. The cell efficiency ranged between 19.9 and 20.4% and showed a narrow efficiency distribution. This paper also presents the development of a boron selective emitter (p+/p++) n-type bifacial solar cell. In this work, the cells were fabricated using the standard cell fabrication process based on tube-furnace thermal diffusion employing liquid sources: BBr3for the front-side boron emitter and POCl3for the rear-side phosphorus back-surface field (BSF). The p+/p++structure was formed by screen-printing resist masking and wet chemical etching technology. Both the front- and rear-side electrodes were obtained by using screen-printed contacts with H-patterns.

80,Impact of silicon wafer thickness on photovoltaic performance of crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells,"The impact of Si wafer thickness on the photovoltaic performance of hydrogenated amorphous silicon/crystalline silicon (a-Si:H/c-Si) heterojunction solar cells was examined from the optical and electrical points of view. Optical characterization of c-Si wafers of various thicknesses showed that a realistic light-trapping scheme, i.e., pyramidally textured Si wafers with a dielectric antireflection coating and a back reflector, realizes an efficient quasi-Lambertian light absorption enhancement, even for very thin wafers. This indicates that high photocurrent densities are achievable by using the realistic light-trapping scheme, assuming that the parasitic absorption loss is minimized. The potentials of open-circuit voltage (VOC) and the fill factor (FF) of thin c-Si cells were investigated using thin c-Si wafers passivated with intrinsic/doped amorphous silicon film stacks. It was experimentally confirmed that the impliedVOCincreases steadily with decreasing wafer thickness down to 30 µm, while the implied FF weakly depends on the thickness. As a result of the trade-off between light absorption and impliedVOC, a high implied efficiency is expected for a wide range of wafer thicknesses. TheVOCincrease by thinning the wafer was also experimentally confirmed in an a-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction cell with a thickness below 60 µm, resulting in a conversion efficiency of 21.0%.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RB10","Hitoshi Sai, Hiroshi Umishio, Takuya Matsui, Shota Nunomura, Tomoyuki Kawatsu, Hidetaka Takato, Koji Matsubara","['Research Center for Photovoltaics, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan', 'Graduate School of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan', 'Renewable Energy Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Koriyama, Japan', 'Komatsu NTC Ltd, Nanto, Japan']",2018,The impact of Si wafer thickness on the photovoltaic performance of hydrogenated amorphous silicon/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells was examined from the optical and electrical points of view.,['amorphous silicon'],[],[],[],"['heterojunction solar', 'silicon heterojunction', 'heterojunction']",[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology', 'University of Tsukuba', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology', 'Komatsu NTC Ltd']",2,"['(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)', '(University of Tsukuba, 0)', '(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)', '(Komatsu NTC Ltd, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy']"

83,Contact resistivity and adhesion of copper alloy seed layer for copper-plated silicon heterojunction solar cells,"To reduce optical loss and contact material cost in silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells, copper plating has been considered as a suitable metallization technique. However, a plated copper contact on indium tin oxide (ITO) generally has low adhesion reliability. For this reason, suitable seed layer materials are required for adhesive copper plating. As a requirement of a suitable seed layer material, contact resistance between the seed and the ITO is also important, as well as the adhesion, since a high series resistance results in a low fill factor. In this work, we applied copper alloy (Cu–X) materials as a seed layer that was deposited by co-evaporating copper with other metals. The contact resistivity (ρc) values of the Cu–X seed layer and copper-plated contact with the Cu–X seed layer (Cu–X/Cu) on the ITO layer were evaluated by the transfer length method (TLM).

In order to accurately measure the long bulk lifetime, a direct-current photoconductive decay method was applied to a rectangular sample with a sectional area larger than 400 mm2. The measurement of an ultra-long bulk lifetime of longer than 20 ms was demonstrated using the P-doped MCZ silicon with a carbon concentration of approximately 5×1014atoms/cm3. Furthermore, the bulk lifetime of MCZ silicon with shorter exposure time at 300–600 °C was extremely short; we believe that the formation behavior of the carbon-related defects in the crystal growth process affect the bulk lifetime. Therefore, not only reducing the carbon concentration but also improving the thermal history at low temperature is effective for increasing the bulk lifetime of as-grown P-doped MCZ silicon.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RB14","Yuta Nagai, Satoko Nakagawa, Hiroyuki Tsubota, Hisashi Matsumura","['GlobalWafers Japan Co., Ltd, Seiro, Japan']",2018,A method for increasing the bulk lifetime of phosphorus-doped magnetic-field-applied Czochralski silicon is provided.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['GlobalWafers Japan Co., Ltd']",1,"['(GlobalWafers Japan Co., Ltd, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

86,N-type silicon solar cell with rear tunnel oxide combined with rear screen-printed electrodes,"In this article, we describe an n-type silicon solar cell with a conversion efficiency of 21.9% on a 156 mm pseudosquare Czochralski (Cz) wafer with a rear tunnel oxide-passivated structure and rear screen-printed electrodes. The thermal degradation of the rear structure during electrode firing was solved by adding a SiNxfilm on the rear surface. Not only the SiNxfilm but also the tunnel oxide structure was chemically etched using fire-through screen-printed electrodes, so that the electrodes contacted directly to the bulk silicon. A phosphorus-diffused layer appeared at the bulk silicon immediately below the tunnel oxide, and this shallowly and densely diffused layer reduced the contact resistivity between the electrodes and the bulk silicon layer. Degradation of rear passivation caused by etching on the tunnel oxide structure was improved by adding a diffused layer using POCl3before chemical oxidation. The diffused layer using POCl3was deep and had a low phosphorus concentration, thus the field effect worked successfully while Auger recombination was not enhanced.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RB16","Kunihiko Nishimura, Yasutoshi Yashiki, Takayuki Morioka, Yumiko Kobayashi, Tatsuro Watahiki, Hidetada Tokioka","['Advanced Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Amagasaki, Japan']",2018,An n-type silicon solar cell with a conversion efficiency of 20% on a 156 mm pseudosquare Czochralski wafer with a rear tunnel oxide-passivated structure and rear screen-printed electrodes.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['Mitsubishi Electric Corporation'],1,"['(Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

First, an ultrathin SiOxfilm is unintentionally formed on the surface of c-Si by annealing c-Si in N2ambient at 350 °C. Then, on the SiOxfilm, two SiNxlayers are sequentially formed at substrate temperatures (Tsub) of 100 and 250 °C by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (Cat-CVD), often called hot-wire CVD.

The Oiconcentration in mono-like Si grown using a Czochralski (Cz) silicon seed was the highest among the three crystals. On the other hand, the Oiand Csconcentrations in HP mc-Si grown using Siemens Si incubation seeds were the same as those in conventional mc-Si.

Additionally, Oiand Csin HP mc-Si grown on the incubation seeds with adequately low Oiand Csconcentrations are distributed similarly to those in conventional mc-Si grown under the same conditions.

In this study, optical properties of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) with submicron diameters were investigated by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method in the infrared wavelength region, in which the absorption coefficient of crystalline Si is quite low and the increase in optical path length is very important. To verify the simulation results, SiNWs with submicron diameters were successfully fabricated by the metal-assisted chemical etching method using two types of etching masks. The optical properties and minority carrier lifetime of the obtained structures were measured, and the results suggest that SiNWs with submicron diameters such as ∼700 nm are effective for both light trapping and the suppression of surface recombination.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RB21","Miki Sei, Yasuyoshi Kurokawa, Shinya Kato, Noritaka Usami","['Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan', 'Department of Frontier Materials, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan', 'PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Kawaguchi, Japan']",2018,A novel light-trapping structure that not only has high light absorptance and can be fabricated with a small etching margin but also has a small surface area for a small effect of surface recombination is provided.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Nagoya University', 'Nagoya Institute of Technology', 'Japan Science and Technology Agency']",2,"['(Nagoya University, 0)', '(Nagoya Institute of Technology, 0)', '(Japan Science and Technology Agency, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

With an increase in the annealing temperature above around 400 °C, the fraction of CZTS decreases and that of Cu2−xS increases. The depth profile analysis shows that Cu segregates to the surface and Cu2−xS is formed on the film. The solar cells fabricated on these samples show that photovoltaic performance is limited by the surface Cu2−xS. The observed external quantum efficiency behavior is consistent with the degradation of carriers collected in the solar cell formed on the CZTS film owing to the presence of the secondary Cu2−xS phase.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RC10","Yosuke Shimamune, Kazuo Jimbo, Genki Nishida, Masanari Murayama, Akiko Takeuchi, Hironori Katagiri","['National Institute of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan']",2018,The present invention is directed to a method of forming a light-absorbing layer on a substrate.,[],[],[],"['sulfur flux', 'sulfur']",[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['National Institute of Technology'],0,"['(National Institute of Technology, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
104,Effect of sodium addition on Cu2SnS3thin-film solar cells fabricated on alkali-free glass substrates,"Cu2SnS3(CTS) p-type semiconductors are expected to be applied as a light absorption material for low-cost thin-film solar cells due to their advantageous physical properties. The influence of sodium addition to CTS thin films was investigated by comparing Na-free CTS and Na-doped CTS fabricated on alkali-free glass substrates. Grain growth for Na-free CTS, which has a Cu/Sn composition ratio of approximately 2.0, did not occur below 570 °C. In contrast, the addition of sodium to the CTS increased the grain sizes with an increase in the annealing temperature. Even with Na-free and Na-doped CTS, the grain sizes increased with a decrease in the Cu/Sn composition ratio. These results show that an excess of Sn combined with the presence of sodium accelerate the grain growth of CTS. Photovoltaic cells using the Na-doped CTS with a Cu/Sn ratio of 1.81 exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 242 mV, a short-circuit current density of 26.5 mA/cm2, a fill factor of 0.523, and a conversion efficiency of 3.35%. The cells using CTS without sodium did not exhibit good photovoltaic characteristics due to the small grain sizes.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RC11","Shohei Sasagawa, Genki Nishida, Akiko Takeuchi, Hironori Katagiri, Hideaki Araki","['National Institute of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan']",2018,The influence of sodium addition to Si thin films was investigated by comparing Si-free Si and Si-doped Si fabricated on alkali-free glass substrates.,[],[],[],"['sodium addition', 'influence sodium', 'sodium']",[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['National Institute of Technology'],0,"['(National Institute of Technology, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

By XRD and Raman analyses, linear transformation of the lattice parameters for Cu2Sn1−xGexS3thin-film alloys with respect to the Ge composition was confirmed to be obeying the Vegard's law. By AC Hall effect measurement, reducing of carrier mobility was observed in the Cu2Sn1−xGexS3thin-film alloys with higher Ge content. By the temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy analysis, it is observed that the red shifting of Raman vibration energy due to the thermal expansion is resembled to that of the temperature dependency of energy bandgap of semiconductors. Anisotropic thermal dilatation behavior was observed in the Cu2Sn1−xGexS3thin-film alloy independent of its Ge composition.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RC12","Takayoshi Okamura, Myo Than Htay, Kohei Yamaguchi, Noriyuki Urakami, Noritaka Momose, Kentaro Ito, Yoshio Hashimoto","['Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Nagano, Japan', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shinshu University, Nagano, Japan', 'Institute of Carbon Science and Technology, Shinshu University, Nagano, Japan']",2018,"The present invention relates to the field of materials science and technology, and more particularly to the field of materials science and technology.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['National Institute of Technology', 'Shinshu University', 'Shinshu University']",0,"['(National Institute of Technology, 0)', '(Shinshu University, 0)', '(Shinshu University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
106,Influence of potassium treatment on electronic properties of Cu(In1−xGax)(Se1−ySy)2solar cells studied by steady state photo-capacitance and admittance spectroscopy,"To clarify the mechanism of efficiency enhancement effect by potassium (K) treatment for Cu(In1−xGax)(Se1−ySy)2(CIGSSe) solar cells, we investigated the physical properties of deep and shallow defect levels of CIGSSe solar cells without or with potassium fluoride treatment via using steady state photo-capacitance and admittance spectroscopy. The results show that the defect density of deep levels (such as 0.8 and 0.7 eV above valance band) are similar, suggesting that the K treatment does not drastically change the deep defect properties. For the shallow levels, the activation energy of interface-related shallow defect decreased from 183 to 120 meV upon K treatment, suggesting the modification of interface. The modified interface may be caused by the diffusion of potassium to grain boundaries and the formation of Cu-depleted layer in the near surface region of CIGSSe, resulting in the prolonged minority carrier lifetime. A new level with activation energy of 250 meV was found after K treatment, and it contributed to the increase of carrier density. These features well explained the enhanced device performance of CIGSSe solar cells by K treatment in terms of defects.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RC13","Shenghao Wang, Xia Hao, Muhammad Monirul Islam, Takuya Kato, Hiroki Sugimoto, Katsuhiro Akimoto, Takeaki Sakurai","['Materials Genome Institute, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China', 'Atsugi Research Center, Solar Frontier K.K, Atsugi, Japan', 'Institute of New Energy and Low-Carbon Technology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China', 'Institute of Applied Physics, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan']",2018,The present invention discloses the mechanism of efficiency enhancement effect by potassium treatment for Group IIIAs solar cells.,[],[],[],"['potassium', 'effect potassium', 'potassium treatment']",[],[],[],"['JP', 'CN']","['JPN', 'CHN']","['Shanghai University', 'Solar Frontier K.K', 'Sichuan University', 'University of Tsukuba']",2,"['(Shanghai University, 0)', '(Solar Frontier K.K, 1)', '(Sichuan University, 0)', '(University of Tsukuba, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
107,Environmental assessment of vacuum and non-vacuum techniques for the fabrication of Cu2ZnSnS4thin film photovoltaic cells,"Cu2ZnSnS4(CZTS) is one of the most promising alternatives for photovoltaic (PV) applications, since it is made from earth abundant and low toxicity materials. To assess the potential of CZTS PV cells in the future global market, it is useful to investigate the sustainability by assessing the possible environmental impacts of large-scale production. Life cycle assessment (LCA) of CZTS absorber layers fabricated by vacuum and non-vacuum deposition techniques has been studied using information from laboratory-scale processes as well as large scale estimations. Copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) was selected as a reference vacuum-based process. The paper compares the environmental impacts of the vacuum and non-vacuum processes by considering the three main damage categories of climate change, human health and eco-toxicity using Sima Pro software. The results show that the CZTS films fabricated with both deposition techniques exhibit a significant potential benefit over the CIGS thin films. The toxicity to human health was found to depend critically on the compounds and components selected for preparing the precursors. The energy consumption for processing the CZTS thin films via the non-vacuum deposition technique is considerably less than that required for the other techniques.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RC14","Mehrnoush Mokhtarimehr, Ian Forbes, Nicola Pearsall","['Thin Films Deposited by Spray Pyrolysis Method, NPAG, Newcastle, U.K']",2018,A method for assessing the environmental impact of vacuum and non-vacuum deposition processes on the production of indium gallium diselenide absorber layers fabricated by vacuum and non-vacuum deposition techniques.,[],[],[],"['indium', 'gallium diselenide', 'indium gallium', 'gallium']",[],[],[],['GB'],['GBR'],['Newcastle University'],0,"['(Newcastle University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of the (Cu1−xLix)In(S1−ySey)2shifted to the lower angle side by the substitution of Li atoms for Cu atoms. The solid solution limit of Li for Cu in (Cu1−xLix)In(S1−ySey)2system widened with increasing Se content,y.

Both the lattice constantsaandcof the (Cu1−xLix)In(S1−ySey)2with a tetragonal chalcopyrite structure increased with increasing Li content,x. The band gaps of (Cu1−xLix)In(S1−ySey)2solid solutions widened with increasing Li content,x. To understand the band diagram of the solid solutions, the energy level of the valence band maximum (VBM) from the vacuum level was determined from the ionization energy measured by photoemission yield spectroscopy (PYS). The energy level of the conduction band minimum (CBM) was also determined by adding the band-gap energy to the VBM level.

The CBM level of the (Cu1−xLix)In(S1−ySey)2solid solution was approximately constant. The Li doping in CuIn(S,Se)2is useful for decreasing the VBM of the CuIn(S,Se)2absorber and increasing the band-gap energy of the CuIn(S,Se)2absorber without increasing the CBM level.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RC15","Takahiro Kusumoto, Tsuyoshi Maeda, Takahiro Wada","['Department of Materials Chemistry, Ryukoku University, Otsu, Japan']",2018,The present invention relates to a single-phase compound of the formula <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> wherein <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n> <n>,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['Ryukoku University'],0,"['(Ryukoku University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

The stabilities of the compounds formed at the interface were studied using density functional theory (DFT) methods. We evaluated the stabilities of MoSe2, Mo3Se4, Mo9Se11, and Mo15Se19in the Mo–Se system and MoS2, Mo2S3, Mo3S4, and Mo15S19in the Mo–S system from the estimated formation enthalpies, ΔHf, using a DFT-D2 approach based on van der Waals (vdW) forces. For CIGS solar cells, we calculated the enthalpy changes of reactions between the CuInSe2–Mo and CuInS2–Mo systems. The enthalpy changes of reactions expressed by CuInSe2+ 1/6Mo → 1/2Cu2Se + 1/6In6Se7+ 1/6MoSe2and CuInS2+ 1/6Mo → 1/2Cu2S + 1/6In6S7+ 1/6MoS2had positive values of +28 and +41 kJ/mol, respectively. The enthalpy changes of others reactions of the CuInSe2(CISe)–Mo and CuInS2(CIS)–Mo systems had positive values, too. These results suggest that CISe and CIS do not easily decompose even when Mo coexists. On the other hand, for Cu2ZnSnSe4(CZTSe) solar cells, the enthalpy change of the reaction expressed by Cu2ZnSnSe4+ 1/2Mo → Cu2Se + ZnSe + SnSe + 1/2MoSe2had a negative value of −11 kJ/mol. The mixed-phase system of Cu2Se + ZnSe + SnSe + 1/2MoSe2is more stable than the Cu2ZnSnSe4+ 1/2Mo system, indicating that CZTSe readily decomposes when Mo coexists. The thickness of the MoSe2layer at the interface between the CZTSe absorber and the Mo back contact tends to increase during the deposition of the CZTSe films. For Cu2SnS3(CTS) solar cells, the enthalpy change of the reaction expressed by Cu2SnS3+ 1/2Mo → Cu2S + SnS + 1/2MoS2had a small negative value of −4 kJ/mol. The mixed phase of the Cu2S + SnS + 1/2MoS2system is slightly more stable than the Cu2SnS3+ 1/2Mo system. CTS decomposes slightly when Mo coexists.

A metallic aluminum target (secondary target) was used to condition the surface of a rotatable ceramic aluminum-doped zinc oxide target (ZnO:Al2O3wt %) as the primary target from which the film was deposited. Consequently, the direct current power applied to the secondary target enabled the variation of doping concentration in the deposited film. An optical transmittance >80% with an improved resistivity (<10−3Ω·cm) and a higher carrier concentration (3×1020–6×1020cm−3) were demonstrated in 300-nm-thick AZO thin films.

117,Quantitative evaluation of thermal runaway tolerance in space solar cells,"In thin-film solar cells such as inverted metamorphic multijunction solar cells, a local shunt spot can cause thermal runaway because of low thermal conductivity along the in-plane direction of the junction. Since electrical performance can be greatly reduced by thermal runaway, an appropriate design of the solar cells is necessary to prevent this mechanism. However, quantitative analysis of the thermal runaway is difficult because its threshold is usually strongly affected by the testing conditions and the characteristics of the shunt spots. In this study, we proposed a method of analyzing the thermal runaway characteristics quantitatively. We intentionally induced a thermal runaway under a simulated space environment with an arbitrary artificial shunt spot by a laser beam. The thermal resistance of the shunt spots and the threshold temperature for the thermal runaway were estimated using electrical and thermal models. This method enables an optimized design of thin-film solar cells.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RD03","Tetsuya Nakamura, Taishi Sumita, Mitsuru Imaizumi","['Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Tsukuba, Japan', 'Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Meguro, Japan']",2018,"In thin-film solar cells such as inverted metamorphic multijunction solar cells, a local shunt spot can cause thermal runaway because of low thermal conductivity along the in-plane direction of the junction.",[],[],[],[],"['multijunction solar', 'junction', 'multijunction', 'metamorphic multijunction', 'direction junction']",[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency', 'The University of Tokyo']",2,"['(Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, 1)', '(The University of Tokyo, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

In the summer under 1 sun, a step-like current–voltage curve was captured, and the reason for this result as well as the cause of lower efficiency values in the summer are proposed herein.

The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of n+-GaAs//ITO/p+-Si and n+-GaAs//ITO/n+-Si junctions without annealing are linear. Those of p+-GaAs//ITO/p+-Si and p+-GaAs//ITO/n+-Si junctions without annealing are nonlinear. Although the interface resistance of all the junctions increases with increasing annealing temperature, the resistances of the respective junctions after the annealing at 400 °C are still smaller than the series resistance of the actual SAB-based InGaP/GaAs//Si hybrid triple-junction cells (∼4 Ω cm2). The n+-GaAs//ITO/n+-Si junction reveals the lowest resistance among the investigated junctions after annealing.

120,Fabrication of GaAs solar cells grown with InGaP layers by hydride vapor-phase epitaxy,"The elevated manufacturing cost of highly efficient III–V multijunction devices limits them to space and high-concentration terrestrial applications. Hydride vapor-phase epitaxy (HVPE), in contrast to metal–organic vapor-phase epitaxy, can reduce the manufacturing costs due to the use of cheaper group III metal sources, capability to grow crystals under a low arsenic overpressure, and its low installation cost. In this study, we characterized the abruptness of the heterointerface between the InGaP and GaAs layers in GaAs solar cells grown by HVPE. InGaP passivation layers, such as the back-surface field (BSF) and window layers, were introduced in order to enhance the performance of the GaAs solar cells. Owing to the reduction of the surface recombination, the devices fabricated with the incorporated window layer showed a significant improvement in the short-wavelength range of the external quantum efficiency response, compared with that obtained for the unpassivated cells. This provided a cell efficiency improvement from 9.25 to 20.75%. However, the introduction of the BSF layer degrades the cell efficiency to 17.92%, owing to the formation of an anomalous interlayer at the GaAs-on-InGaP heterointerface.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RD06","Ryuji Oshima, Kikuo Makita, Akinori Ubukata, Takeyoshi Sugaya","['Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation, Tsukuba, Japan', 'Research Center for Photovoltaics, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan']",2018,"Inride vapor-phase epitaxy, in contrast to metal–organic vapor-phase epitaxy, can reduce the manufacturing costs due to the use of cheaper group III metal sources, capability to grow crystals under a low arsenic overpressure, and its low installation cost.",[],[],[],"['arsenic overpressure', 'arsenic', 'low arsenic']",[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology']",1,"['(Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation, 1)', '(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
121,Enhancement of open-circuit voltage in InGaP solar cells grown by solid source molecular beam epitaxy,"The growth of ternary InGaP alloys is often susceptible to atomic ordering, which can lead to an anomalous bandgap reduction as well as the formation of antiphase boundaries (APBs). In this study, we report on the effect of growth rate and growth temperature on the performance of lattice-matched In0.52Ga0.48P solar cells grown on GaAs(001) substrates miscut 2° toward (111)B by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy. The bandgap of the InGaP film was widened from 1.855 eV for a film grown at 480 °C and 1.0 µm/h to 1.880 eV for a film grown at 510 °C and 1.5 µm/h owing to the suppression of atomic ordering in the alloy. In terms of solar cell performance, the open-circuit voltage was improved from 1.243 to 1.311 V by increasing the growth temperature and the growth rate due to not only the wideningEgbut also the improved electrical characteristics (due to the fewer APBs present). In addition, the decreased number of APBs improved the fill factor and short-circuit current density. Consequently, the highest η of 14.43% was obtained for an InGaP single-junction solar cell grown at 510 °C and 1.5 µm/h and that of 25.57% for a dual-junction InGaP/GaAs solar cell.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RD07","Ryuji Oshima, Yuki Nagato, Yoshinobu Okano, Takeyoshi Sugaya","['Tokyo City University, Setagaya, Japan', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan']",2018,"The growth of ternary indium gallium arsenide alloys is often susceptible to atomic ordering, which can lead to an anomalous bandgap reduction as well as the formation of antiphase boundaries .",[],['gallium arsenide'],[],"['indium', 'lead anomalous', 'gallium', 'lead', 'indium gallium', 'ordering lead']",[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Tokyo City University', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology']",2,"['(Tokyo City University, 0)', '(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Performance of Solar Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy']"

The global solar spectrum distribution was assessed using the average photon energy (APE) and spectral matching ratio (SMR) indexes in this study. The conversion efficiency of the IMM module was more than 30% and was markedly affected by APE rather than by module temperature under real environmental conditions.markedly increased in the high APE region. In the case of APE of more than 1.60 eV, the photocurrent of the bottom subcell decreased owing to the blue-rich spectrum, which limited the short-circuit current. The absorption region of the bottom subcell overlapped with the water absorption region in the solar spectrum; therefore, environmental conditions such as water precipitation greatly affected the output of the current-matching inverted triple-junction solar cell.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RD08","Yasuyuki Ota, Kohsuke Ueda, Tatsuya Takamoto, Kensuke Nishioka","['Organization for Promotion of Tenure Track, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan', 'Sharp Corporation, Yamatokoriyama, Japan', 'Faculty of Engineering, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan']",2018,The outdoor operation of a fixed flat sub module with an indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/indium gallium arsenide/in,[],['gallium arsenide'],[],"['indium', 'gallium', 'indium gallium']","['triple-junction solar', 'inverted triple-junction', 'triple-junction']",[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['University of Miyazaki', 'Sharp Corporation', 'University of Miyazaki']",2,"['(University of Miyazaki, 0)', '(Sharp Corporation, 1)', '(University of Miyazaki, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
123,Growth of InGaAs(P) in planetary metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy reactor using tertiarybutylarsine and tertiarybutylphosphine for photovoltaic applications,"The effects of wafer (surface) temperature on the surface morphologies of InP, InGaAsP, and InGaAs grown in a planetary metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) reactor using tertiarybutylarsine (TBA) and tertiarybutylphosphine (TBP) as group V precursors were investigated. Compared with small horizontal reactors, InP growths require a relatively low temperature to prevent TBP predecomposition and parasitic gas-phase reactions. However, such a low temperature can prevent the surface migration of In adatoms and degrade surface morphology, especially when a substantial amount of Ga precursors is present. Hence, growths of InGaAs require a higher temperature than that of InP and InGaAsP.

A fundamental absorption edge was observed in the photon energyħω region of 1.5–1.6 eV by both techniques. In addition, extra absorption of about 102cm−1was detected atħω < 1.5 eV only in the spectra measured by resonant-PBS. This extra absorption seems to indicate the existence of localized states in the bandgap of CH3NH3PbI3films. The difference between resonant-PBS and FTPS profiles below the absorption edge is caused by the difference in measurement mechanism, that is, resonant-PBS utilizes a temperature rise of the sample by the nonradiative recombination of photoexcited carriers, while FTPS measures photocurrent arriving at electrodes by the electric field after the photoexcitation. These results seem to indicate that resonant-PBS is a useful tool for the defect estimation of CH3NH3PbI3.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RE07","Yuta Hirota, Hiroki Kato, Kouki Kawahara, Norimitsu Yoshida, Shuichi Nonomura","['Department of Energy Engineering, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan', 'Department of Electrical, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan', 'Graduate School of Engineering, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan', 'Next Generation Energy Research Center, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan']",2018,The measurement of the optical absorption coefficient spectra of perovskite thin films by resonant photothermal bending spectroscopy and UV-transform photocurrent spectroscopy for the defect estimation of the material has been attempted.,[],[],"['spectra perovskite', 'perovskite films', 'perovskite']",[],[],[],[],"['JP', 'JPN']","['None', 'JPN']","['Gifu University', 'Gifu University', 'Gifu University', 'Gifu University']",0,"['(Gifu University, 0)', '(Gifu University, 0)', '(Gifu University, 0)', '(Gifu University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
134,Effect of aromatic nitrogen heterocycle treatment on the performance of perovskite solar cells,"In this study, the effect of the aromatic N-heterocycle treatment on the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was examined. The device architecture in this study was as follows: fluorine-doped SnO2-coated glass (FTO glass)/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3)/2,2',7,7'-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)/Au. A perovskite film was post-treated with three different aromatic N-heterocycles for the passivation of the interface. The overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased in the following order: triazine > pyrimidine > pyridine. An overall PCE of 16.0% (backward scan) was achieved for the triazine treatment under optimized conditions, although a large hysteresis was observed. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements show that the triazine-treated perovskite film afforded a longer photoluminescence lifetime than the untreated perovskite film. These results indicate that triazine is the most effective for the enhancement of the cell performance among the three aromatic N-heterocycles.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RE08","Nobuko Onozawa-Komatsuzaki, Takurou N.

Solution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cells consisting of PC61BM and DRCN5BT-HH gave a highVocof 1.10 V and markedly improved power conversion efficiencies up to 3.26% after solvent vapor annealing (SVA). The effects of SVA on the morphology and microstructure of the active layer were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). For DRCN5BT-HH, crystallization, orientation, and molecular ordering were improved, and a fibrillar structure was formed with acicular aggregates of the donor. For DRCN5BT-TT, no marked structural changes were induced by SVA.

However, TiO2remained in the FTO–Au junction at the cell connection part: this appeared to create a series resistance that degraded the performance of the module. UV laser treatment was examined for application to the cell connection part to minimize this resistance. The results showed that the resistivity of the cell connection part, which was conventionally 0.26 Ω·cm2, was reduced to 0.1 Ω·cm2by this laser treatment. We designed the solar module based on the value of a contact resistivity of 0.1 Ω·cm2and the current–voltage curve of a small single cell. As a result of prototyping solar cell modules (35 cells in series) with an aperture area of 354 cm2on a 203×203 mm2glass substrate, a module efficiency of 12.6% was achieved.

Quantum conductance between iodide ligand attached surfaces has the highest value due to its extra ligand contribution near Fermi level. However, configurations with bromide and chloride ligands have much higher maximum quantum conductance due to their stronger coupling between surfaces with lower distances. The electrical fields formed between PbSe(110) surfaces attenuates the charge transport whereas between (111) surfaces it improves the transport near fermi level. In spite of the existence of electrical field and lower surface to surface distance, the zero-voltage bias transport between (001) surfaces is stronger.

We investigated energy transfer between the Er3+and Ni2+dopants using time-resolved measurements of both Ni2+and Er3+emissions. Most of the Ni2+dopants occupied the six-coordinated Ga sites in the synthesized powder samples. Under 1.1–1.45 µm excitation, energies absorbed by the six-coordinated Ni2+sensitizers almost perfectly transferred to the Er3+emitters, leading to upconversion (UC) emission of the Er3+at 0.98 µm. Combined with the UC emission directly excited at 1.45–1.65 µm, a broad sensitivity range of 1.1–1.65 µm was realized. However, the internal quantum efficiency of the UC emission was lower than that of previously developed La(Ga0.5Sc0.5)O3:Er,Ni,Nb, most likely owing to energy dissipation to a small amount of the Ni2+dopants locating at the four-coordinated Ga sites.

We prepared the InGaP-based InP QD cells with the front i-InGaP layer and compared them with the cells without the front i-InGaP layer. The insertion of the front i-InGaP layer results in an increase in quantum efficiency in the visible region, indicating that the short-wavelength light absorbed at the InGaP host increases the short-circuit current density in the cell. In addition, a thick host layer leads to reduced quantum efficiency below the host bandgap energy, which indicates that the thermal escape from QDs is suppressed.

For the stationary use and optical fiber connection of the SPL-PV combination in which the incident angles of the laser light to the PV cells (ϕ) change within 5–10°, double-cavity bandpass filters realize the required angle selection function. When the SPLs illuminate moving electric vehicles equipped with the PV cells at larger ϕ values, shortpass filters are appropriate. These specially designed angle-selective filters provide significant light trapping performance and consequently absorbances higher than the Yablonovitch limit up to ϕ = 45°.

150,"Exploring suitable damp heat and potential induced degradation test procedures for Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se) photovoltaic modules","To ensure a longer lifetime for photovoltaic (PV) modules, many accelerated test standards are being developed or revised. Among the test standards, damp heat (DH) testing in the dark is widely employed to test the module durability. However, in the field, high temperature is usually accompanied by light irradiation. This difference can result in a degradation not observed in the field, especially in the case of Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se) (CIGS) PV modules. To explore suitable test procedures that simulate performance in the field appropriately, we investigated the effects of light irradiation and forward biasing, during DH testing and potential induced degradation (PID) testing of CIGS PV modules. In the case of the CIGS product we have tested, both light irradiation and forward biasing have suppressed degradation in DH as well as PID tests, and no degradation was found after light soaking. These results suggest the needs to add corresponding option(s) to the relevant test standards.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RG02","Keiichiro Sakurai, Hiroshi Tomita, Darshan Schmitz, Shuuji Tokuda, Kinichi Ogawa, Hajime Shibata, Atsushi Masuda","['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan', 'Solar Frontier, Atsugi, Japan']",2018,The effects of light irradiation and forward biasing during damp heat testing and potential induced degradation testing of photovoltaic modules are investigated.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology', 'Solar Frontier']",1,"['(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)', '(Solar Frontier, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Performance of Solar Systems']"
151,Effect of viscoelasticity of ethylene vinyl acetate encapsulants on photovoltaic module solder joint degradation due to thermomechanical fatigue,"The solder joint degradation due to thermomechanical fatigue is investigated in this paper for photovoltaic (PV) mini-modules with ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) of different viscoelastic properties. The mini-modules were laminated at different curing temperatures in order to obtain EVA encapsulation with different viscoelastic properties. The influence of viscoelasticity of EVA on the thermomechanical fatigue generated on solder joint is analyzed based on a two-dimensional (2D) finite-element model. Based on simulation of thermomechanical stresses accumulation, mini-modules with EVA cured at lower temperatures accumulated approximately 40% more stresses during the thermal cycle testing than mini-modules with optimal cured EVA. The tested mini-modules with EVA cured at lower temperature showed greater power degradation than the optimal cured mini-modules. An apparent increase in equivalent series resistance is the primary factor the power loss. A good correlation between the accumulated thermomechanical fatigue and the increase in equivalent series resistance is demonstrated with the tested samples.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RG03","Jiang Zhu, Michael Owen-Bellini, Daniel Montiel-Chicharro, Thomas R.

These measurements showed the appearance of high Na concentrations near the finger electrodes and at the top of texture structures of the SiNxfilm surface. However, a high current conductivity of SiNxfilms was observed at halfway between two finger electrodes and at the top of texture structures.

This study mainly focuses on the analysis of the long-term performance of the PV modules using indices such as energy yield, reference yield, performance ratio (PR), and characterization indices of the main electrical parameters as well as degradation rate. Average annual energy yields were 1880 h for Module 1 and 1789 h for Module 2. Thus, PRs were 0.85 and 0.80, while the average annual reference yield was 2223 h. On the other hand, degradation rates of Modules 1 and 2 were −1.28 and −0.86%/year, respectively.

For the precise evaluation of a PV module, an accurate temperature measurement technique is required. It is necessary to measure the temperature of the solar cell in a module structure (junction temperature) because it determines the temperature characteristics of the PV module, rather than the temperature of the backsheet. In this study, a PV module with an internal thermocouple was fabricated. A thermocouple was inserted immediately below the solar cell so that it could be in direct contact with the cell, enabling an accurate temperature measurement. Moreover, the temperature of the solar cell in the PV module structure was predicted by heat flux calculation using the backsheet temperature, which can be measured easily. In this manner, the solar cell temperature was estimated accurately within an error of ±1 °C.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RG08","Kensuke Nishioka, Kazuyuki Miyamura, Yasuyuki Ota, Minoru Akitomi, Yasuo Chiba, Atsushi Masuda","['Research Center for Photovoltaics, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tosu, Japan', 'Organization for Promotion of Tenure Track, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan', 'Faculty of Engineering, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan']",2018,"A thermocouple is inserted immediately below the solar cell so that it could be in direct contact with the cell, enabling an accurate temperature measurement.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology', 'University of Miyazaki', 'University of Miyazaki']",2,"['(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)', '(University of Miyazaki, 0)', '(University of Miyazaki, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy']"

The relationships of instability and nonuniformity of irradiance with measurement conditions are discussed, e.g., a long measurement time worsens instability. When events are observed with repeated measurements under certain conditions and selected under the condition that the instability is low afterwards, the nonuniformity of the selected events is low. This means that for measuring and detecting uniform events well, two sensors are required, but they can also be detected with a single sensor by repeated measurements and selecting with instability. This suggests that repeated measurements may be a filtering method for finding stable and uniform events, which is required for high-accuracy outdoor PV module performance characterizations.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RG10","Junfang Zhang, Kota Watanabe, Jun Yoshino, Tomonao Kobayashi, Yoshihiro Hishikawa, Takuya Doi","['Department of Environmental and Renewable Energy Systems, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan', 'The Research Center for Photovoltaics, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan']",2018,"The temporal instability and spatial nonuniformity of solar irradiance, and their relationship are analyzed by field observations, and a method of detecting the events in which irradiance is stable and uniform is proposed for outdoor photovoltaic module performance characterizations.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Gifu University', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology']",2,"['(Gifu University, 0)', '(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
159,Physical process and statistical properties of solar irradiance enhancement observed under clouds,"Solar irradiance intensity is usually reduced by cloud shading. However, an enhancement of solar irradiance has rarely been detected. For the detection of irradiance enhancement events, high-speed pyranometers are employed here. The enhancement is detected in almost one-third of days in a month on average in central Japan. From sky-camera observation and meteorological analysis, the enhancement occurs owing to the superimposition of the diffuse irradiance scattered at the edges of cumulus clouds near the sun on the direct irradiance passing through a gap in the clouds, which exist along meteorological fronts. Events of solar irradiance enhancement were detected in a five-month observation period and were analyzed statistically. Some of the events with the largest enhancement are amplified by more than 1.6, and their durations are from 30 s to 4 min. Statistical analyses showed events with either large amplifications or long durations but not events with both large amplifications and long durations.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RG11","Junfang Zhang, Kota Watanabe, Jun Yoshino, Tomonao Kobayashi, Yoshihiro Hishikawa, Takuya Doi","['Department of Environmental and Renewable Energy Systems, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan', 'The Research Center for Photovoltaics, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan']",2018,The invention relates to the detection of solar irradiance enhancement events by means of high-speed pyranometers.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Gifu University', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology']",2,"['(Gifu University, 0)', '(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Performance of Solar Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy']"
160,Short-period fluctuation and spatial distribution of solar irradiance under clouds,"Recently, outdoor photovoltaic (PV) module performance characterizations have been carried out mainly for testing installed PV modules. For high-accuracy outdoor measurement, solar irradiance with stability in time and uniformity in space are required. Short-period temporal instability and spatial nonuniformity of solar irradiance are observed using a series of PV module sensors (PVMSs). The speed and direction of cloud shadows moving on PVMSs are evaluated from the fluctuations of irradiance detected by several PVMSs. On the basis of cloud distribution, weather conditions are classified into four types, and the characteristics of solar irradiance fluctuations are examined for each type. The irradiance changes quickly under cumulous clouds. On the other hand, the irradiance becomes weak, but its short-period fluctuations are not evident under layered clouds. The amplitude of irradiance fluctuations reaches 70% of clear-day irradiance at noon in this observation. The spatial nonuniformity evaluated on the basis of the instantaneous difference in irradiance intensity between two PVMSs also reaches 1.8%/m of clear-day irradiance.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RG12","Junfang Zhang, Kota Watanabe, Jun Yoshino, Tomonao Kobayashi, Yoshihiro Hishikawa, Takuya Doi","['Department of Environmental and Renewable Energy Systems, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan', 'The Research Center for Photovoltaics, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan']",2018,The spatial nonuniformity of solar irradiance is evaluated on the basis of the instantaneous difference in irradiance intensity between two solar module sensors.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Gifu University', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology']",2,"['(Gifu University, 0)', '(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

Clear effects on PID delay were observed in the case of light irradiation with a UV component below approximately 400 nm. On the other hand, almost no effects were observed in the case of light irradiation without a UV component. Delay of PID progress was also observed even under high-humidity condition. It was also found that PID progresses in a partially shadowed region even under UV light irradiation, which means that a partial shadow easily brings about PID for PV modules exposed outdoors.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RG13","Atsushi Masuda, Yukiko Hara","['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan']",2018,"In a potential-induced degradation test for p-type crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules, light irradiation during a potential-induced degradation test for p-type crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules is studied under various test conditions.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology'],1,"['(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

We first localized the PID-affected region in terms of degradation intensity on the modules on the basis of EL. The carrier dynamics in that region are then studied and clarified in terms of carrier lifetime, defect level, and photogenerated carrier density. Our results suggest that carrier relaxation in a fresh solar cell proceeds via band to band and/or shallow and deep donor–acceptor recombination. However, the dominant recombination in solar cells with PID is intercenter charge transfer via shallow-to-deep and/or deep–deep defects for which the carrier lifetime decreased drastically. Also, it is found that the carrier dynamics near the surface and bulk do not progress similarly as confirmed using 532- and 1064-nm-wavelength pumps.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RG14","Mohammad Aminul Islam, Takuya Oshima, Daisuke Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Matsuzaki, Hidenari Nakahama, Yasuaki Ishikawa","['Nisshinbo Mechatronics Inc, Okazaki, Japan', 'Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Japan', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan']",2018,"In this study, transient diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and electroluminescence analysis have been employed to clarify the carrier dynamics in potential-induced degradation in single-crystalline Si solar cell.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Nisshinbo Mechatronics Inc', 'Nara Institute of Science and Technology', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology']",2,"['(Nisshinbo Mechatronics Inc, 1)', '(Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 0)', '(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Performance of Solar Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy']"

The long-wavelength tail of SR shifts toward longer wavelengths as the temperature increases. Although the wavelength shift Δλ per temperature difference ΔTis dependent on the device structure and λ, the present results show that the shift in the quantum efficiency (QE), which is related to SR by QE ≈ SR×1240/λ, can be approximated using the wavelength-independent constant of Δλ/ΔT∼ 0.45 nm/K for various types of c-Si device.

A comprehensive analysis was conducted by visual inspection, electrical performance evaluation, and system final yield evaluation. Visual inspection revealed the yellowing and delamination of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), and cracks in the backsheet were found to be the most frequent defects. It is possible to perform a comparison between final and initial parameters. The average performance degradation over 30 years from 1986 to 2016 is 6.51%. The annual average degradation has been found to be only 0.22%/year. System output power and performance ratio (PR) were also analyzed, giving an annual PR of 69.72%.

Black surfaces are often visually appealing and, if based on a black photoabsorber, may lead to increased panel efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a combination of black silicon and black ribbons (or bus-bars), both fabricated with methods that are compatible with production lines of screen-printed, front contacted solar panels. Maskless, non-cryogenic reactive ion etch of silicon and subsequent coating with aluminum oxide for passivation purposes results in average reflectance of less than 1% in the UV–vis part of the solar spectrum, and in minority carrier lifetimes similar to those obtained on polished reference samples thanks to minimized surface damage, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Inorganic blackening of bus-bars by a combination of electroplating and chemical etching results in reflectance values lower than 3.5% in the UV–vis, with no modifications to standard stringing equipment required.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.57.08RH01","Beniamino Iandolo, Io Mizushima, Rasmus S.

Aggregators perform day-ahead scheduling for efficient energy management in some optimized method as ways. For optimization, however, criterions of values could change with the time or situation. In this study, we propose a method to investigate and compare various kinds of day-ahead charge/discharge schedulings based on different evaluation indices. First, we show that feasible schedulings are expressed as superpositions of reference schedulings obtained by simple strategies. Then, the method is applied to an aggregator with consumers who each has rooftop PVs and battery energy storage systems. A fairness index is defined as a correlation coefficient between battery usage and grid usage.

In this paper, the balancing group formulates an optimal plan to guarantee a highly efficient operation of conventional generators and the group's maximum output from PV generators simultaneously. The aggregator is provided a planned power flow (PPF) via a communication network by the balancing group in advance. Under these prerequisites, we propose a two-stage scheme for the demand side that consists of a day-ahead allocation algorithm of PPF and a real-time battery energy storage system (BESS) operation algorithm. The first stage of the scheme is almost the same as the case of the centralized effective BESS control, taking into account the maximum use of distributed BESSs.

It is considered to have potential for increasing the power output of bifacial photovoltaic modules, primarily owing to enhanced light reflectance from the ground and also reduced operation and maintenance cost through effective weed control. In this study, we investigated the effect of white foam glass spread in the photovoltaic installation site by measuring the albedo factor and observing the growth of weeds that are known to create shadows over a period of time. An effective increase in albedo was observed after spreading the white foam glass. The transmittance of the white foam glass was very low and the sunlight did not reach the ground below it.

In this work, we demonstrate the ability to measure the interface defect density distributionDit(E) and the fixed interface charge densityQffor ultra-thin passivation layers operating within the tunnel regime (<2 nm). Various promising tunnel layer candidates [i.e., wet chemically formed SiOx, UV photo-oxidized SiOx, and atomic layer deposited (ALD) AlOx] are investigated for their potential application forming electron or hole selective tunnel layer passivated contacts. In particular, ALD AlOxis identified as a promising tunnel layer candidate for hole-extracting passivated contact formation, stemming from its high (negative) fixed interface charge density in the order of −6×1012cm−2. This is an order of magnitude higher compared to wet chemically or UV photo-oxidized formed silicon oxide tunnel layers, while keeping the density of interface defect statesDitat a similar level (in the order of ∼2×1012cm−2eV−1).

The open-circuit voltage of the device is observed to transition to the open-circuit voltage of the non-shunted sub cell as the shunting increases. In the same way, the fill factor is found to be more significantly affected when ohmic shunts occur in the current-limiting sub cell. Finally, as the current-limiting sub cell is shunted, the short-circuit current of the device is observed to transition to the short-circuit current of the non-current-limiting sub cell.

183,Surface passivation and carrier selectivity of the thermal-atomic-layer-deposited TiO2on crystalline silicon,"Here, we demonstrate the use of an ultrathin TiO2film as a passivating carrier-selective contact for silicon photovoltaics. The effective lifetime, surface recombination velocity, and diode quality dependence on TiO2deposition temperature with and without a thin tunneling oxide interlayer (SiO2or Al2O3) on p-type crystalline silicon (c-Si) are reported. 5-, 10-, and 20-nm-thick TiO2films were deposited by thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) in the temperature range of 80–300 °C using titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and water. TiO2thin-film passivation layers alone result in a lower effective carrier lifetime compared with that with an interlayer. However, SiO2and Al2O3interlayers enhance the TiO2passivation of c-Si surfaces. Further annealing at 200 °C in N2gas enhances the surface passivation quality of TiO2tremendously. From these findings, design principles for TiO2–Si heterojunction with optimized photovoltage, interface quality, and electron extraction to maximize the photovoltage of TiO2–Si heterojunction photovoltaic cells are formulated. Diode behaviour was analysed with the help of experimental, analytical, and simulation methods. It is predicted that TiO2with a high carrier concentration is a preferable candidate for high-performance solar cells. The possible reasons for performance degradation in those devices with and without interlayers are also discussed.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MA11","Maksym M.

184,Investigation of material properties and thermal stabilities of magnetron-sputter-deposited ZnO:Al/Ag/ZnO:Al transparent conductive coatings for thin-film solar cell applications,"Transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) have been widely used in various optoelectronic devices. Among these TCOs, indium–tin oxide (ITO) is the most commonly used TCO material. However, owing to the scarcity of indium, there exists a strong need to replace ITO with an alternative transparent conductive coating. A TCO/metal/TCO-based multilayer structure has been considered as one promising candidate. In this work, several Al-doped ZnO (AZO) AZO/Ag/AZO samples were prepared with different Ag thicknesses. The AZO/Ag/AZO structure allows a low sheet resistance of around 10 Ω/sq and a visible transmission above 80% achieved with an overall thickness of ∼110 nm. The optimisation of front AZO thickness helps to reduce reflection via destructive interferences. We demonstrated that the adhesion strength of the stacks can be improved by modifying top AZO deposition conditions. The adhesive tape test confirms good film adhesion (i.e., peel-off strength) to the glass substrate. The annealing studies confirm good thermal stabilities of the fabricated sandwich structure.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MA12","Stella Van Eek, Xia Yan, Weimin Li, Sascha Kreher, Selvaraj Venkataraj","['FHR Anlagenbau GmbH, Ottendorf-Okrilla, Germany', 'Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), National University of Singapore, Singapore']",2017,"The present invention relates to a multilayer structure comprising a conductive oxide, a metal and a metal oxide.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['DE', 'SG']","['DEU', 'SGP']","['FHR Anlagenbau GmbH', 'National University of Singapore']",2,"['(FHR Anlagenbau GmbH, 1)', '(National University of Singapore, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

It is found that, for dedicated n-type lifetime samples under illumination, there is no light induced degradation (LID) but enhanced passivation. The lifetime increase happened with a much faster speed compared to the lifetime decay during dark storage, resulting in the overall lifetime enhancement for actual field application scenarios (sunshine during the day and darkness during the night). In addition, it was found that the lifetime enhancement is spectrally dependent and mainly associated with the visible part of the solar spectrum. Hence, it has negligible impact for such interfaces applied on the rear of the solar cells, for example p-type aluminum local back surface field (Al-LBSF) cells.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MB01","Fen Lin, Mei Gi Toh, Maung Thway, Xinhang Li, Naomi Nandakumar, Xavier Gay, Bas Dielissen, Samuel Raj, Armin G.

We validate our methodology using the example of an industrial feasible p-type multicrystalline silicon ""passivated emitter and rear cell"" process. Applying the metamodel, we investigate the impact of each input parameter on the distribution of cell efficiencies in a variance-based sensitivity analysis, identifying the parameters and processes that need to be improved and controlled most accurately. We show that if these could be optimized, the mean cell efficiencies of our examined cell process would increase from 17.62% ± 0.41% to 18.48% ± 0.09%. As the method relies on advanced characterization and simulation techniques, we furthermore introduce a simplification that enhances applicability by only requiring two common measurements of finished cells.

187,Bifacial aspects of industrial n-Pasha solar cells,"Bifacial photovoltaic (PV) modules make optimal use of diffuse and ground-reflected light. The gain in energy yield depends on both the local climatic conditions and the PV system layout. These determine the additional irradiance on the rear of the PV panels. The rear response of the (laminated) solar cell(s) determines how much additional energy this rear irradiance generates. Based on our experiments and simulations, the main parameters that determine the bifaciality factor of solar cells with a front side junction are the rear metal coverage, the base resistivity and the diffusion profile on the rear. These will be evaluated and discussed in this paper. Front-junction solar cells with low base resistivity have a lower short circuit current when illuminated from the rear due to enhanced recombination in the BSF. Stencil printed rear metallization yields a higher bifaciality factor compared to screen printed by reducing the metal coverage and consumption and maintaining the front side efficiency. For our optimized 239 cm2bifacial cell we estimate that the output with 20% contributed by the rear side is equivalent to that of a 24.4% efficient monofacial cell.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MB03","Bas B.

While long-time storage deteriorates the effective lifetime of all samples, a short ambient plasma treatment improves their passivation qualities. By studying the influence of the plasma treatment parameters on the passivation layers, an optimized process condition was identified which even boosted the passivation quality beyond its original value obtained immediately after deposition. On the other hand, the absence of stringent requirement on gas precursors, vacuum condition and longtime processing makes the ambient plasma treatment an excellent candidate to replace conventional thermal annealing in industrial heterojunction solar cell production.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MB04","Jia Ge, Markus Prinz, Thomas Markert, Armin G.

189,Improved understanding of the recombination rate at inverted p+silicon surfaces,"The effect of positive fixed charge on the recombination rate at SiNx-passivated p+surfaces is studied in this work. It is shown that a high positive fixed charge on a low defect density, passivated doped surface can result in a near injection level independent lifetime in a certain injection level range. This behaviour is modelled with advanced computer simulations using Sentaurus TCAD, which replicates the measurements conditions during a photoconductance based effective minority carrier lifetime measurement. The resulting simulations show that the shape of the injection level dependent lifetime is a result of the surface recombination rate, which is non-linear due to the surfaces moving into inversion with increasing injection level. As a result, the surface recombination rate switches from being limited by electrons to holes. Equations describing the surface saturation current density,J0s, during this regime are also derived in this work.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MB05","Alexander To, Fajun Ma, Bram Hoex","['School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, University of New South Wales Australia, Sydney, Australia']",2017,"The shape of the injection level dependent lifetime is a result of the surface recombination rate, which is non-linear due to the surfaces moving into inversion with increasing injection level.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['AU'],['AUS'],['University of New South Wales'],0,"['(University of New South Wales, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

It is concluded that TeO2aids the reduction of molten glass frit viscosity during contact co-firing. This in turn, leads to uniform flow of molten glass frit, both in the gridline bulk and interface of gridline and SiNx. Therefore, the uniform wetting and etching of SiNxand consequently larger contact area of metal to Si compared to its counterpart without TeO2.

193,Improved opto-electronic properties of silicon heterojunction solar cells with SiOx/Tungsten-doped indium oxide double anti-reflective coatings,"Amorphous SiOxwas prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) to form SiOx/tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO) double anti-reflective coatings for silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell. The sheet resistance of SiOx/IWO stacks decreases due to plasma treatment during deposition process, which means thinner IWO film would be deposited for better optical response. However, the comparisons of three anti-reflective coating (ARC) structures reveal that SiOxfilm limits carier transport and the path of IWO–SiOx–Ag structure is non-conductive. The decrease of sheet resistance is defined as pseudo conductivity. IWO film capping with SiOxallows observably reduced reflectance and better response in 300–400 and 600–1200 nm wavelength ranges. Compared with IWO single ARC, the average reflection is reduced by 1.65% with 70 nm SiOx/80 nm IWO double anti-reflective coatings (DARCs) in 500–1200 nm wavelength range, leading to growing external quantum efficiency response, short circuit current density (Jsc), and efficiency. After well optimization of SiOx/IWO stacks, an impressive efficiency of 23.08% is obtained with highJscand without compromising open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor. SiOx/IWO DARCs provide better anti-reflective properties over a broad range of wavelength, showing promising application for SHJ solar cells.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MB09","Jian Yu, Jie Zhou, Jiantao Bian, Liping Zhang, Yucheng Liu, Jianhua Shi, Fanying Meng, Jinning Liu, Zhengxin Liu","['Research Center for New Energy Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shanghai, P.

Although boron diffusion leads to a degradation of the sample lifetime, phosphorus diffusion and hydrogenation is effective at recovering the lifetime in the intra-grain region and at the grain boundaries respectively.

A thin Al2O3film deposited by remote-plasma ALD was very effective at reducing the emitter saturation current density (J0e) of epitaxial p+-emitter to 16.2 fA/cm2, compared to theJ0eof 184.9 fA/cm2by thermal SiO2films. This reduction inJ0eenables an increase in an implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) from 630 to 688 mV. Quokka simulation shows that about a 1.1% absolute efficiency increase in the calculated baseline efficiency of a 15.1% of the ultrathin Si solar cell can be achievable by enhancing emitter surface passivation without changing the concentration in either the epi-emitter or epi-base.

Similar advanced hydrogenation processes can also be applied to multi-crystalline silicon passivated emitter with rear local contact (PERC) cells, however to date, the processes take longer and are less effective. Modifications to the firing processes can also suppress CID in multi-crystalline cells during subsequent illumination.

198,Interdigitated back contact solar cells with polycrystalline silicon on oxide passivating contacts for both polarities,"We demonstrate an independently confirmed 25.0%-efficient interdigitated back contact silicon solar cell with passivating polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) on oxide (POLO) contacts that enable a high open circuit voltage of 723 mV. We use n-type POLO contacts with a measured saturation current density ofJ0n= 4 fA cm−2and p-type POLO contacts withJ0p= 10 fA cm−2. The textured front side and the gaps between the POLO contacts on the rear are passivated by aluminum oxide (AlOx) withJ0AlOx= 6 fA cm−2as measured after deposition. We analyze the recombination characteristics of our solar cells at different process steps using spatially resolved injection-dependent carrier lifetimes measured by infrared lifetime mapping. The implied pseudo-efficiency of the unmasked cell, i.e., cell and perimeter region are illuminated during measurement, is 26.2% before contact opening, 26.0% after contact opening and 25.7% for the finished cell. This reduction is due to an increase in the saturation current density of the AlOxpassivation during chemical etching of the contact openings and of the rear side metallization. The difference between the implied pseudo-efficiency and the actual efficiency of 25.0% as determined by designated-area light current–voltage (I–V) measurements is due to series resistance and diffusion of excess carriers into the non-illuminated perimeter region.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MB15","Felix Haase, Fabian Kiefer, Sören Schäfer, Christian Kruse, Jan Krügener, Rolf Brendel, Robby Peibst","['Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH), Emmerthal, Germany', 'Institute of Electronic Materials and Devices, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hannover, Germany', 'Institute for Solid State Physics, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hannover, Germany', 'Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hannover, Germany']",2017,An independently confirmed 25.0%-efficient interdigitated back contact silicon solar cell with passivating polycrystalline silicon on oxide contacts that enable a high open circuit voltage of 723 mV.,['polycrystalline silicon'],[],[],[],[],[],[],['DE'],['DEU'],"['Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin', 'Leibniz Universität Hannover', 'Leibniz Universität Hannover', 'Leibniz Universität Hannover']",2,"['(Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin, 1)', '(Leibniz Universität Hannover, 0)', '(Leibniz Universität Hannover, 0)', '(Leibniz Universität Hannover, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
199,Recombination sources in p-type high performance multicrystalline silicon,"This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the electronic properties of an industrially grown p-type high performance multicrystalline silicon ingot. Wafers from different positions of the ingot are analysed in terms of their material quality before and after phosphorus diffusion and hydrogenation, as well as their final cell performance. In addition to lifetime measurements, we apply a recently developed technique for imaging the recombination velocity of structural defects. Our results show that phosphorus gettering benefits the intra-grain regions but also activates the grain boundaries, resulting in a reduction in the average lifetimes. Hydrogenation can significantly improve the overall lifetimes, predominantly due to its ability to passivate grain boundaries. Dislocation clusters remain strongly recombination active after all processes. It is found that the final cell efficiency coincides with the varying material quality along the ingot. Wafers toward the ingot top are more influenced by carrier recombination at dislocation clusters, whereas wafers near the bottom are more affected by a combination of their lower intra-grain lifetimes and a greater density of recombination active grain boundaries.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MB16","Hang Cheong Sio, Sieu Pheng Phang, Peiting Zheng, Quanzhi Wang, Wei Chen, Hao Jin, Daniel Macdonald","['Research School of Engineering, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia', 'Jinko Solar Co., Ltd, Jiangxi, China']",2017,A comprehensive assessment of the electronic properties of an industrially grown p-type high performance multicrystalline silicon ingot is presented.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['AU', 'CN']","['AUS', 'CHN']","['The Australian National University', 'Jinko Solar Co., Ltd']",2,"['(The Australian National University, 0)', '(Jinko Solar Co., Ltd, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Performance of Solar Systems']"

Different ITO deposition conditions are used, which result in significant differences in the performance of HET solar cells. It is found that HET solar cells with ITO films deposited at room temperature exhibit severer sputter damage, while those with substrate heating show less damage. Besides the ITO deposition temperature, the sputtering gas ambient is also investigated. The hydrogen gas used in the ITO deposition can greatly affect the interface properties between the ITO film and the amorphous silicon layers.

Numerical simulation reveals that the electron affinity (χ) of the MoOxmaterial strongly influences the performance of the MoOxcontacted p-Si cell. Simulated band diagrams show that the values in χ of the MoOxlayer must be sufficiently high in order to lower junction recombination, indicating that the highest efficiency of 21.1% is achievable for a high χ of 5.6 eV of MoOxfilms and back surface recombination velocity of <100 cm/s at p-Si/MoOx.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MB18","Woojun Yoon, James E Moore, Eunhwan Cho, David Scheiman, Nicole A Kotulak, Erin Cleveland, Young-Woo Ok, Phillip P.

The captured information allows the computation of sample reflectance as a function of wavelength and coordinates, thereby constituting a spectral reflectance map. The derived values match that obtained from monochromator-based measurements. Optical inspection is then based on the characteristic reflectance of surface features at optimally contrasting wavelengths. The technique reveals otherwise hidden stains and anti-reflection coating (ARC) non-uniformities, and enable more selective visualization of grains in multicrystalline Si wafers. Optical contrast enhancement of metallization significantly improves accuracy of metal detection. The high effective resolution of the monochrome camera also allows fine metallization patterns to be measured. The rapid succession of flash-and-image-capture at each wavelength makes the reported optical metrology technique amenable in photovoltaic manufacturing for solar wafers/cells sorting, monitoring and optimization of processes.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MB19","Jian Wei Ho, Jessica Li Jian Koh, Johnson Kai Chi Wong, Samuel Raj, Eric Janssen, Armin G.

203,Amorphous silicon passivation for 23.3% laser processed back contact solar cells,"This paper presents amorphous silicon deposited at temperatures below 200 °C, leading to an excellent passivation layer for boron doped emitter and phosphorus doped back surface field areas in interdigitated back contact solar cells. A higher deposition temperature degrades the passivation of the boron emitter by an increased hydrogen effusion due to lower silicon hydrogen bond energy, proved by hydrogen effusion measurements. The high boron surface doping in crystalline silicon causes a band bending in the amorphous silicon. Under these conditions, at the interface, the intentionally undoped amorphous silicon becomes p-type conducting, with the consequence of an increased dangling bond defect density. For bulk amorphous silicon this effect is described by the defect pool model. We demonstrate, that the defect pool model is also applicable to the interface between amorphous and crystalline silicon. Our simulation shows the shift of the Fermi energy towards the valence band edge to be more pronounced for high temperature deposited amorphous silicon having a small bandgap. Application of optimized amorphous silicon as passivation layer for the boron doped emitter and phosphorus doped back surface field on the rear side of laser processed back contact solar cells, fabricated using four laser processing steps, yields an efficiency of 23.3%.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MB20","Kai Carstens, Morris Dahlinger, Erik Hoffmann, Renate Zapf-Gottwick, Jürgen H.

However, the patterning of back-contact electrodes causes the increase in fabrication cost. Thus, to simplify the fabrication of back-contact cells, we attempted to form p-a-Si/i-a-Si/c-Si and n-a-Si/i-a-Si/c-Si regions by the conversion of a patterned area of p-a-Si/i-a-Si/c-Si to n-a-Si/i-a-Si/c-Si by plasma ion implantation. It is revealed that the conversion of the conduction type can be realized by the plasma ion implantation of phosphorus (P) atoms into p-a-Si/i-a-Si/c-Si regions, and also that the quality of passivation can be kept sufficiently high, the same as that before ion implantation, when the samples are annealed at around 250 °C and also when the energy and dose of ion implantation are appropriately chosen for fitting to a-Si layer thickness and bulk c-Si carrier density.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MB21","Koichi Koyama, Noboru Yamaguchi, Daisuke Hironiwa, Hideo Suzuki, Keisuke Ohdaira, Hideki Matsumura","['ULVAC, Inc, Chigasaki, Japan', 'Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Nomi, Japan']",2017,A back-contact amorphous-silicon/crystalline silicon heterojunction is one of the most promising structures for high-efficiency solar cells.,[],[],[],[],"['silicon heterojunction', 'heterojunction', 'heterojunction solar', 'heterojunction promising']",[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['ULVAC, Inc', 'Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology']",2,"['(ULVAC, Inc, 1)', '(Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

Both the open-circuit voltage and the fill factor heavily depend on the parameters of the annealing step after aluminium layer deposition. Using numerical device simulations and in accordance with the literature, we demonstrate that the changes in solar cell parameters with annealing can be explained by the formation of an aluminium silicide layer at temperatures as low as 150 °C, improving the contact resistance and thus enhancing the fill factor. Further annealing at higher temperatures initialises the crystallisation of the amorphous silicon layers, yielding even lower contact resistances, but also introduces more defects, diminishing the open-circuit voltage.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MB22","Johann-Christoph Stang, Jan Haschke, Mathias Mews, Agnes Merkle, Robby Peibst, Bernd Rech, Lars Korte","['École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Neuchâtel, Switzerland', 'Institute of Silicon Photovoltaics, Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin, Berlin, Germany', 'Institute for Solar Energy Research Hameln, Emmerthal, Germany']",2017,The formation of an aluminium silicide layer at temperatures as low as 150 C improves the contact resistance and thus enhances the fill factor.,[],[],[],"['aluminium metallisation', 'formation aluminium', 'aluminium silicide', 'aluminium']","['silicon heterojunction', 'heterojunction', 'heterojunction solar']",[],[],"['DE', 'CH']","['DEU', 'CHE']","['École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne', 'Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin', 'Institute for Solar Energy Research Hameln']",2,"['(École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 0)', '(Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin, 1)', '(Institute for Solar Energy Research Hameln, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Performance of Solar Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

The cell efficiency was independently confirmed by the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS).

In the Cu-doped CdS/CdTe solar cells, broad emissions at 910–950 nm, which were probably caused by donor–acceptor pair (DAP) emission between CuCdacceptors and ClTedonors, were observed. The intensity of the junction PL markedly increased owing to the Cu doping. This result suggests that the intensity of junction PL is relevant to the conversion efficiency of CdTe solar cells. Furthermore, the PL peak energy increased with increasing excitation wavelength.

Compared to our previous record cell with 20.9% efficiency, the major breakthrough is due to the increasedVoc, benefited from potassium treatment. A lower reverse saturation current and a longer carrier collection length deduced from electron-beam induced current indicate that the degree of carrier recombination at the heterojunction and depletion region for the 22.3% cell is lower. Further characterizations (capacitance–voltage profiling, temperature-dependentVoc, Suns–Voc) and analysis indicate that the recombination coefficients at all regions were reduced, especially for the interface and depletion regions. Device simulation was performed assuming varying defect densities to model the current–voltage curve for the 22.3% cell.

All growth parameters other than V/III ratio were carefully controlled for an accurate comparison. Nearly identical cell performance characteristics including short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) indicate that cell performance is independent of V/III ratio.

215,Investigation of miniband formation and optical properties of strain-balanced InGaAs/GaAsP superlattice structure embedded in p–i–n GaAs solar cells,"To improve the superlattice (SL) solar cell performance, we carried out an accurate estimation of transition energies and miniband widths and focused on understanding of the optical properties of the SL structure using piezoelectric photothermal (PPT), photoreflectance (PR), and photoluminescence (PL) methods. Solar cell structure samples with different barrier thicknesses from 2.0 to 7.8 nm in quantum wells were prepared. From the PR and theoretical calculation, the formation of a miniband was confirmed. The PL peak showed a redshift and a decrease in signal intensity with decreasing barrier thickness, which were explained by carrier separation as a consequence of electron transportation through the miniband without recombination.

216,Effects of substrate miscut on the properties of InGaP solar cells grown on GaAs(001) by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy,"The growth of ternary InGaP alloys is often susceptible to atomic ordering, which leads to an anomalous bandgap reduction as well as the formation of antiphase boundaries (APBs). The effect of substrate miscut on the performance of lattice-matched In0.52Ga0.48P solar cells grown on GaAs(001) substrates by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy (SS-MBE) is investigated. A B-type miscut enhanced single-variant atomic ordering even with SS-MBE, resulting in a bandgap (Eg) reduction from 1.87 eV for an alloy grown on an exact substrate to 1.85 eV for that grown on the substrate miscut 6° toward (111)B. Conversely, an A-type miscut suppressed the formation of atomic ordering, resulting in theEgwidening of the alloy grown on the substrate miscut 6° toward (111)A to 1.89 eV. With regard to solar cell performance, InGaP solar cells grown on A-type miscut substrates enhanced the open-circuit voltage (VOC) andWOC(=Eg/q−VOC) because of the low degree of atomic ordering. Large improvements inWOCand efficiency to 0.58 V and 10.93%, respectively, were obtained for the cell grown on the substrate miscut 2° toward (111)B. A reduction in the number of APBs due to single-variant atomic ordering was related to this latter result.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MC08","Ryuji Oshima, Yuki Nagato, Yoshinobu Okano, Takeyoshi Sugaya","['Tokyo City University, Setagaya, Japan', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan']",2017,"The growth of ternary indium gallium arsenide alloys is often susceptible to atomic ordering, which leads to an anomalous bandgap reduction as well as the formation of antiphase boundaries .",[],['gallium arsenide'],[],"['indium', 'gallium', 'indium gallium']",[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Tokyo City University', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology']",2,"['(Tokyo City University, 0)', '(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Performance of Solar Systems', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy']"

However, the conversion efficiency of AIGS solar cells is still lower than that required for the top cell. In this study, to improve the conversion efficiency of AIGS solar cells, we controlled the conduction band offset (CBO) at the buffer layer/ZnO and buffer layer/AIGS interfaces. The reduction in interface recombination at the CdS buffer layer/AIGS interface was achieved by introducing a ZnS(O,OH) buffer layer instead of a CdS buffer layer, although the fill factor (FF) decreased markedly because the CBO at the ZnS(O,OH)/ZnO interface prevented the electron flow under a forward bias. We found that the introduction of a CdS/ZnS(O,OH) hybrid buffer layer is efficient in controlling the CBO at both the buffer layer/AIGS and buffer layer/ZnO interfaces and improving the solar cell conversion efficiency.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MC09","Takeshi Umehara, Faris Akira Bin Mohd Zulkifly, Kazuyoshi Nakada, Akira Yamada","['Department of Physical Electronics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Japan', 'Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Japan']",2017,The conduction band offset at the buffer layer/NnO and buffer layer/NnO interfaces is controlled to improve the solar cell conversion efficiency.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Tokyo Institute of Technology', 'Tokyo Institute of Technology']",0,"['(Tokyo Institute of Technology, 0)', '(Tokyo Institute of Technology, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy']"

The ion transport in solid imidazolium iodides used as the quasi-solid state electrolyte (EL) of DSCs was investigated. The imidazolium EL, whose melting point is ca. 100 °C, was chosen to fully penetrate in porous TiO2by the heat permeation method. The apparent diffusion coefficients (D) of I3−in porous TiO2are on the order of 1,3-dimethly-imidazolium (DM+) > 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium > 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium > 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium.Dincreases with decreasing imidazolium cation size. Therefore, the effective distance between I−and I3−was assumed to decrease with decreasing cation size. The transport-limited current of DM+at the TiO2thickness of 20 µm is ca. 30 mA·cm−2.

The incorporation of Te atoms into GaAs was approximately two orders larger than that of S atoms. Although only 30% of Te atoms could be electrically activated, a carrier concentration of 1019cm−3was achieved.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements revealed that sodium atoms out-diffused at the surface region during KF deposition. Water and ammonia rinsing processes of KF-treated CIGS thin films reduced alkali metals from the surface.

On the other hand, ammonia rinsing removed the Cu-poor region from the surfaces of KF-treated CIGS thin films affecting the growth (or nucleation) of the CdS layer. The surface coverage of the CdS layer deposited on the ammonia-rinsed KF-treated CIGS thin film was inferior to than that of water-rinsed samples, resulting in the poor cell performance due to an increased interface recombination.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MC12","Ishwor Khatri, Kosuke Shudo, Junpei Matsuura, Mutsumi Sugiyama, Tokio Nakada","['Research Institute for Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Japan', 'Faculty of Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Japan']",2017,"In this work, potassium fluoride-treated Si thin films were rinsed in ammonia and water solutions before buffer layer deposition and the effects of rinsing on photovoltaic properties were investigated.",[],[],[],"['potassium', 'work potassium']",[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Tokyo University of Science', 'Tokyo University of Science']",0,"['(Tokyo University of Science, 0)', '(Tokyo University of Science, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy', 'Performance of Solar Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

In addition, in a tandem solar cell configuration, the bottom cell receives a spectrum that is filtered by the top cell. The performance of the bottom cell at low light intensity is thus of great importance. In this paper, we study various types of silicon solar cells under various light intensities and filtered spectra. We find that, as expected, the short-circuit current varies linearly with the illumination intensity, regardless of the input spectrum. However, we also observe that for a constant number of incident photons but different long-pass filters (i.e., different photogeneration profiles), the short-circuit current density of the solar cells reduces with increasing cut-on wavelength of the used filter. According to our analysis, the loss in short-circuit current can be partly explained by the strong wavelength dependence of the external quantum efficiency at long wavelengths (1050–1200 nm) as well as the different carrier generation profiles under filtered spectra.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MC13","Maung Thway, Nasim Sahraei, Zekun Ren, Soo Jin Chua, Armin G.

CIGS on PI-coated SLG shows Na diffusion from the substrate, which should be controlled to obtain high efficiencies. Further incorporation of Na was achieved by enhancing diffusion from the substrate or by external incorporation using post-deposition treatment (PDT) methods. Both methods lead to a high efficiency of approximately 15%.

However, using solar power requires thoughtful design of the power system, as well as a careful management of the power consumption, especially for devices with cellular communication (because of their higher power consumption). A design approach can minimize system size, weight, and/or cost, while maximizing device performance (data transmission rate and persistence). In this contribution, we describe our design approach for a small form-factor, solar-powered GPS tracker with cellular communication. We evaluate the power consumption of the device in different stages of operation. Combining measured power consumption and the calculated energy-yield of a solar cell, we estimate the battery capacity and solar cell area required for 5 years of continuous operation. We evaluate trade-offs between PV and battery size by simulating the battery state of charge.

232,Effects of dust accumulation and module cleaning on performance ratio of solar rooftop system and solar power plants,"Thailand is an agricultural country, with rice, sugar, and cassava as the major export products. Production of rice, sugar cane, and cassava entails agricultural activities that give rise to significant airborne dusts. In this work, five photovoltaic (PV) units (one solar rooftop and four power plants) are selected for the study. From the study of dust accumulation on glass surface located near rice farms, it was found that opaque areas due to the deposition of dust are 11–14% after 1–2-week exposure. As a consequence, PV system performance is affected. Performance ratio was calculated to determine these effects. Overall results reveal that during the dry and hot seasons, dust deposition significantly affects the performance ratio. The performance ratio reduces by 1.6–3% for 1-month dust accumulation and reduces by 6–8% for 2-month dust accumulation. After cleaning the dust accumulated, the performance ratio greatly increases, resulting in the increase in the energy output by 10%. This increase provides economic and cost benefits of PV cleaning. The performance ratio is not significantly changed during the rainy season, which PV modules are relatively clean as the dust is washed away by rain. It was also found that most of the solar power plants in Thailand still rely on manual cleaning of PV modules with washing water followed by wiping. However, only one power plant, employs a machine for cleaning, resulting in lower cleaning costs.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08ME02","Nattakarn Sakarapunthip, Dhirayut Chenvidhya, Surawut Chuangchote, Krissanapong Kirtikara, Tanokkorn Chenvidhya, Wandee Onreabroy","[""Department of Tool and Materials Engineering (TME), King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"", 'Centre of Excellence on Energy Technology and Environment, Science and Technology Postgraduate Education and Research Development Office, Bangkok, Thailand', ""Thonburi (KMUTT), King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"", ""Department of Physics, King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"", ""Pilot Plant Development and Training Institute (PDTI), King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand""]",2017,A method for improving the performance of a photovoltaic system by cleaning the dust accumulated on the photovoltaic system.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['TH'],['THA'],"[""King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok"", 'Science and Technology Postgraduate Education and Research Development Office', ""King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok"", ""King Mongkut's University of Technology"", ""King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok""]",0,"[""(King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok, 0)"", '(Science and Technology Postgraduate Education and Research Development Office, 0)', ""(King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok, 0)"", ""(King Mongkut's University of Technology, 0)"", ""(King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok, 0)""]",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
233,Preparation of axial-type wire-structure crystalline silicon solar cells,"The fabrication of an axial-type microwire-structure silicon (Si-MW) solar cell has been studied, and it is compared with the radial-type Si-MW solar cell. In this study, a number of microwires were formed on a p-type Si wafer and an n-layer were fabricated on the top region of microwires to form p–n junctions. After that, Si-MWs were filled with an Al1−xOxfilm, deposited by thermal atomic layer deposition, and silica particles, respectively. Then, the Al1−xOxfilm and silica particles on the n-layer were removed by chemical mechanical polishing to form an electrical contact with the electrode. As a result, we obtained a conversion efficiency of 8.2% from the axial-type Si-MW solar cell. In addition, compared with a radial-type Si-MW solar cell, a higher quantum efficiency was obtained in the short-wavelength region (300–600 nm) for the axial-type Si-MW solar cell.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.56.08MA09","Yusuke Shirayanagi, Yasutoshi Yashiki, Shinya Kato, Makoto Konagai","['Advanced Research Laboratories, Tokyo City University, Setagaya, Japan', 'Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Koriyama, Japan', 'Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan']",2017,An axial-type microwire-structure silicon solar cell having a higher quantum efficiency in the short-wavelength region.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Tokyo City University', 'Japan Science and Technology Agency', 'Nagoya Institute of Technology']",2,"['(Tokyo City University, 0)', '(Japan Science and Technology Agency, 1)', '(Nagoya Institute of Technology, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy']"

Increase of growth temperature from 700 to 800 °C leads to the enlargement of surface dip diameters by a factor of more than two through the increase of QDs lateral sizes. In addition, the wet etching rate of the stacked Ge QDs depends on the Ge composition in the QDs and the dislocation generation in the Ge QD multilayer structures. The surface dips with larger diameters leads to an enhanced optical absorption in the near-infrared region. These results show that varying the growth temperature of QDs is effective to control the photonic nanostructures geometry and optical properties.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KA01","Osamu Aonuma, Yusuke Hoshi, Takeshi Tayagaki, Alexey Novikov, Dmitry Yurasov, Noritaka Usami","['Institute for Physics of Microstructures, Russian Academy of Science, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia', 'Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan', 'Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University, Uji, Japan', 'Nizhny Novgorod State University, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia']",2015,The surface dip diameters in photonic nanostructures can be tuned by changing the growth temperature of GaNs.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['JP', 'RU']","['RUS', 'JPN']","['Russian Academy of Science', 'Nagoya University', 'Kyoto University', 'Nizhny Novgorod State University']",2,"['(Russian Academy of Science, 1)', '(Nagoya University, 0)', '(Kyoto University, 0)', '(Nizhny Novgorod State University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

With reasonable switched-off point of anodization current atRof 10%, the selective growth of Si nanowire growth was favorable and 1-µm-long Si nanowire arrays were successfully grown. It was interesting that their structures were epitaxial structures; whereas, long anodization of AAO was found to be unfavorable for growth of Si nanowires due to anodization of Si surface.

236,Practical concept of an all-optical hot carrier solar cell,"The all-optical hot carrier solar cell (aoHCSC) is an intriguing device concept which circumvents HC thermalization by feeding HCs into local radiative recombination centers. These have transition energies above the HC absorber (HCA) bandgap and are located within the HCA to match the HC ballistic mean free path, suppressing HC cooling as major loss mechanism. HC energy extraction proceeds by photon emission. We propose a technologically feasible concept of the aoHC energy converter (aoHCEC) which feeds into a conventional solar cell with its bandgap matching the emitted photons. Using real materials, the concept builds upon waveguides within a HCA which consist of highly polar direct bandgap material to promote radiative carrier recombination.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KA03","Dirk König, Yao Yao","['Lattice-Matched Hot Carrier Solar Cell with Energy Selectivity Integrated into Hot Carrier Absorber Dirk König', 'School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering (SPREE), Binesh Puthen-Veettil et al, Sydney, Australia']",2015,The all-optical hot carrier solar cell is an intriguing device concept which circumvents Raman thermalization by feeding Ramans into local radiative recombination centers.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['AU'],['AUS'],"['Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie', 'School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering']",2,"['(Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie, 1)', '(School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Power Conversion Efficiency in Solar Cells', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy', 'Performance of Solar Systems']"

Since the energy gaps in IBSCs need to be adjusted to optimum values to achieve sufficiently high conversion efficiency, it is important to control precisely the band configuration of intermediate-band (IB) materials. In this study, we demonstrated the control of the IB energy configuration in GaAs:N δ-doped SLs by changing their structural parameters. Optical transitions due to the SL minibands related to the N-induced conduction subbands E+and E−were clearly observed and the transition energies depended systematically on the N area density and period length of the SLs.

The light trapping mechanism is interpreted in terms of a one-dimensional photonic crystal, and the design guide to optimize the multilayer structure has been clarified.

For the fabrication of a solar cell device, a heterojunction with a-Si:H was chosen because its processing temperature is less than 200 °C, at which point Ge atoms cannot diffuse into Si layers. In this study, we developed a guideline for the most appropriate cell structures to take advantage of the Ge layer by fabricating heterojunction solar cells with various structures. As a result, we confirmed that the carriers absorbed in Ge quantum dots contributed output current when Ge quantum dots are fabricated on the pn-junction side. Hence, the presence of built-in potential in a Ge dot layer was found to be necessary to extract the carriers generated in the Ge layer. In addition, carrier transport in Ge quantum dots is improved under conditions of reverse bias. Therefore, the electrical field in the Ge layer is a key parameter to improve solar cell performance in our proposed structure.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KA06","Isao Takahashi, Yusuke Hoshi, Takeshi Tayagaki, Takafumi Oikawa, Keisuke Ohdaira, Noritaka Usami","['Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan', 'Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University, Uji, Japan', 'Si quantum dot solar cell Seong Hyun Lee', 'Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Nomi, Japan']",2015,A new structure for solar cells that consists of photonic nanostructures coupled with vertically aligned Si quantum dots on a crystalline Si substrate.,[],[],['quantum dots'],[],['heterojunction'],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Nagoya University', 'Kyoto University', 'here is no institution mentioned in the provided affiliation', '', 'N/A', 'Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology']",0,"['(Nagoya University, 0)', '(Kyoto University, 0)', 'There is no institution mentioned in the provided affiliation.', '', '(N/A, 0)', '(Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy', 'Performance of Solar Systems']"

Due to the shape of the indents (squares with 4 µm sides and clear diagonals) the position of the marks can be located with high precision by various microscopes. This makes it possible to correlate the results from scanning electron microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy techniques on the same place of the sample, with a precision down to individual nanowires, obtaining new information about the electronic inhomogeneity.

We conducted the epitaxial crystal growth of SiGe with approximately 75% Ge fraction due to solid phase crystallization (SPC) from amorphous silicon–germanium (a-SiGe) precursors on n-type (100) Si substrates. We evaluated the preparation conditions of a-SiGe precursors for the SPC epitaxial growth. The epitaxial growth was successfully conducted and (100)-oriented c-SiGe films were formed. The epitaxial growth was effectively promoted in the a-SiGe precursors prepared at the substrate temperature from 250 to 300 °C, but is not sufficiently promoted in the a-SiGe precursors prepared below 250 °C. The density of a-SiGe precursors is relatively low at the substrate temperature below 250 °C, and the low-density structures cause the impurity incorporation from the air-exposed surface. The impurities are probably the main cause of disturbance of the epitaxial growth. On the other hand, the random crystallization occurred in the SPC of the a-SiGe precursors prepared at 350 °C.

In this paper, we discuss the advantages of the quadruple junction design over the common tandem design, which is ascribed mainly to the fact that the total absorber thickness can be increased while electronic properties and stability are maintained or even improved. The role of the µc-SiOx:H intermediate reflector is highlighted and an optimization of the doping concentration in this layer is presented. Furthermore, the advantage of the high maximum power voltage for the monolithic cell interconnection laser design of modules is shown.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KB03","Simon Kirner, Sebastian Neubert, Christof Schultz, Onno Gabriel, Bernd Stannowski, Bernd Rech, Rutger Schlatmann","['Institute of Silicon Photovoltaics, Berlin, Germany', 'Hochschule für Wirtschaft und Technik, Berlin, Germany', 'PVcomB, Berlin, Germany']",2015,"In this paper, we discuss the advantages of the quadruple junction design over the common tandem design, which is ascribed mainly to the fact that the total absorber thickness can be increased while electronic properties and stability are maintained or even improved.",[],[],[],[],"['quadruple junction', 'junction', 'junction design']",[],[],['DE'],['DEU'],"['Institute of Silicon Photovoltaics', 'Hochschule für Wirtschaft und Technik, Berlin', 'PVcomB']",2,"['(Institute of Silicon Photovoltaics, 0)', '(Hochschule für Wirtschaft und Technik, Berlin, 0)', '(PVcomB, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
249,Effects of front and rear texturing on absorption enhancement in laser-crystallized silicon thin-films on glass,"The paper reports effects of front and rear texturing and their combinations on absorption enhancement in liquid phase crystallized (LPC) silicon (Si) thin-films on glass. In order for Si films to remain continuous after LPC, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the glass at the glass–Si interface has to be less than 600 nm. The LPC Si on textured glass produces elongated grains of several hundred microns in width and up to centimeters in length, comparable to the films crystallized on planar glass. Texturing of the glass–Si interface is found to give the highest potentialJsc; 25.3 mA/cm2, or 24% enhancement compared to a planar reference film, with air as back surface reflector. It confirms the largest light-trapping effect at this interface in superstrate-oriented LPC Si thin-film solar cells due to both lower reflection and enhanced light scattering over the whole solar spectrum.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KB04","Mohd Zamir Pakhuruddin, Jonathan Dore, Jialiang Huang, Sergey Varlamov","['School of Physics, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia', 'Suntech R&D Australia, Botany, Australia', 'School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia']",2015,The paper reports effects of front and rear texturing and their combinations on absorption enhancement in liquid phase crystallized silicon thin-films on glass.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['AU', 'MY']","['AUS', 'MYS']","['Universiti Sains Malaysia', 'Suntech R&D Australia', 'University of New South Wales']",2,"['(Universiti Sains Malaysia, 0)', '(Suntech R&D Australia, 1)', '(University of New South Wales, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

251,Simulation study of effect of heteroepitaxial growth on crystalline germanium heterojunction solar cell,"The impact of crystalline silicon (c-Si) heteroepitaxial growth on a crystalline germanium (c-Ge) heterojunction solar cell has been investigated by numerical simulation. It is revealed that the defect state density of the c-Si heteroepitaxial growth layer does not significantly affect the conversion efficiency, in contrast to the case of a c-Si heterojunction solar cell. A valence band offset between the c-Ge and the c-Si heteroepitaxial growth layer prevents recombination at the defect states. On the other hand, interface defect states have a greater impact on the performance due to the weak built-in potential. From these results, reducing the effect of the interface defects is essential to improve the solar cell performance.

The density of states (DOS) of BaCuSeF was calculated with the hybrid functional of Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) 06. ΔH[VCu] was found to be very small under both the Cu- and Q-rich conditions, which probably contributes to p-type conduction.

We found that open circuit voltage (VOC) was clearly improved from 0.66 to 0.75 V withEgof 1.4 eV, althoughVOCwas only increased from 0.63 to 0.64 V withEgof 1.2 eV. For high efficiency, we fabricated Cu(In,Ga)Se2solar cells with a single-graded band profile and an averageEgof 1.4 eV.

First, the as-grown film was heat-treated to improve its crystallinity. Air was selected as the heat-treatment atmosphere to avoid the precipitation of indium that occurs at high temperatures, and the crystallinity of the as-grown film was successfully improved by adopting this first-step heat treatment. The film with crystallinity improved by the first-step treatment was then heat-treated in N2to lower its resistivity. The resistivity of the film could be lowered about three orders of magnitude compared with that of the as-grown film after the second-step heat treatment under conditions at which the optical transmittance of the film remained sufficiently high in the wavelength region from 350 to 2000 nm.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KC09","Yuichi Sato, Tadahiko Aoshima, Yuhei Muraki","['Properties of Germanium-Doped Indium Oxide Thin Films Prepared by DC Magnetron Sputtering, Akita University, Akita, Japan']",2015,A two-step heat treatment is carried out on a zirconium-doped indium oxide thin film epitaxially grown on ac-face sapphire substrate by a radio-frequency magnetron sputtering method.,[],[],[],"['indium', 'indium oxide', 'zirconium-doped indium']",[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['Akita University'],0,"['(Akita University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

Both near-band-edge PL intensity and decay time of the CIGS absorber layer enhanced after sulfurization.

The open-circuit voltage (Voc), hence conversion efficiency, improved after sulfurization. The photovoltaic performance of the solar cells was consistent with PL intensity. Moreover, it is found for the first time from the SIMS analysis that the Cu atoms were depleted at the surface of CIGS layer after sulfurization, which could result in the improvedVoc.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KC10","Ishwor Khatri, Isamu Matsuyama, Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Hirofumi Fukai, Tokio Nakada","['Research Institute for Science and Technology, Noda, Japan']",2015,The open-circuit voltage of a solar cell is improved by sulfurizing the absorber layer of the solar cell.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['Research Institute for Science and Technology'],0,"['(Research Institute for Science and Technology, 0)']",1,"['Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy']"

268,Innovative front end processing for next generation CIS module production,"The successful implementation of two new process steps into an existing Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2(CIS) production line was achieved. One, a newly developed back contact, aims for a better process control, as far as the transition of the metallic back contact to a selenide/metal bi-layer during CIS-formation is concerned. This was done by the introduction of a corrosion resistant barrier layer, which reliably stops chalcogenide diffusion from the top. By doing so, a back contact layer is obtained, with well defined properties in which the functionalities of the back electrode now is divided between two separated layers. The other development presented in this paper, tackles the complexity of CIS-module production and the interferences between the different processes required. By shifting the P1-scribing process after i-ZnO deposition, the process sequence for CIS is simplified and it will be shown that this new P1i exhibits superior properties as far as CIS morphology and groove quality is concerned.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KC12","Volker Probst, Axel Jasenek, Christian Sandfort, Andreas Letsch, Immo Koetschau, Thomas Hahn, Jochen Feichtinger, Heinz Eschrich","['Robert Bosch GmbH, Corporate Research, Gerlingen-Schillerhöhe, Germany', 'Bosch Solar CISTech GmbH, Brandenburg a. d.

269,"Potential-induced degradation of Cu(In,Ga)Se2photovoltaic modules","Potential-induced degradation (PID) of Cu(In,Ga)Se2(CIGS) photovoltaic (PV) modules fabricated from integrated submodules is investigated. PID tests were performed by applying a voltage of −1000 V to connected submodule interconnector ribbons at 85 °C. The normalized energy conversion efficiency of a standard module decreases to 0.2 after the PID test for 14 days. This reveals that CIGS modules suffer PID under this experimental condition. In contrast, a module with non-alkali glass shows no degradation, which implies that the degradation occurs owing to alkali metal ions, e.g., Na+, migrating from the cover glass. The results of dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry show Na accumulation in the n-ZnO transparent conductive oxide layer of the degraded module. A CIGS PV module with an ionomer (IO) encapsulant instead of a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate shows no degradation. This reveals that the IO encapsulant can prevent PID of CIGS modules. A degraded module can recover from its performance losses by applying +1000 V to connected submodule interconnector ribbons from an Al plate placed on the test module.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KC13","Seira Yamaguchi, Sachiko Jonai, Kohjiro Hara, Hironori Komaki, Yukiko Shimizu-Kamikawa, Hajime Shibata, Shigeru Niki, Yuji Kawakami, Atsushi Masuda","['Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), Nomi, Japan', 'School of Materials Science, Japan', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Kurume National College of Technology, Kurume, Japan', 'Research Center for Photovoltaic Technologies, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan']",2015,An ionomer encapsulant can prevent degradation of photovoltaic modules fabricated from integrated submodules.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST)', 'School of Materials Science', 'Kurume National College of Technology', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology']",2,"['(Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), 0)', '(School of Materials Science, 0)', '(Kurume National College of Technology, 0)', '(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
270,Effect of deposition pressure on the properties of magnetron-sputter-deposited molybdenum back contacts for CIGS solar cells,"Molybdenum (Mo) thin films were deposited onto soda-lime glass substrates by DC magnetron sputtering of a Mo target at various chamber pressures ranging from 1.5×10−3to 7.5×10−3mbar. The film properties were analysed with regards to their application as back electrode in copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) solar cells. It is observed that the resulting film morphology and microstructure were strongly affected by deposition pressure. Mo films deposited at a low pressure possess a high density and a low sheet resistance. These films also have a compact microstructure and a compressive strain, which lead to poor adhesion. The adhesion can be improved by increasing the chamber pressure, which has negative effects on the sheet resistance, optical reflection and porosity of the films. On the basis of these results, a method has been established to fabricate low-resistivity Mo films on soda-lime glass with very good adhesion for CIGS solar cell applications.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KC14","Weimin Li, Xia Yan, Armin G.

TR-PL measurements were carried out on the bare CZTSSe thin films, CdS covered CZTSSe films and on solar cell structure using a femtosecond laser. The sample containing high Cu/Sn ratio of 1.85 shows the lowest lifetime, while films with Cu/Sn ratios of 1.65 and 1.75 show almost equal lifetime. The difference in lifetime between the CdS covered and solar structure samples is not remarkable. This demonstrates domination of recombination than charge separation by electric field. The bare films show extremely small lifetime. To examine surface quality, TR-PL emission spectra of uncovered CZTSSe and Cu(In,Ga)Se2(CIGS) films were measured with two different excitation wavelengths of 420 and 750 nm, which generate excess carriers at different depths in absorbers.

The bandgap of ZCGSe films was controlled from 1.66 to 1.80 eV by incorporating Zn into CuGaSe2(CGSe,xfrom 0 to 0.4). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of ZCGSe films with the Zn/(Zn + Cu + Ga) (Zn/Metal) ratio of the film of less than 0.3 were similar to those of CGSe, and impurity phases such as Ga2Se3and ZnSe were not observed. However, the peaks related to ZnSe were observed in the film with the Zn/Metal ratio of 0.4. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics showed that efficiencies were almost the same at the Zn/Metal ratio of the films from 0.1 to 0.3. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) increased to 0.91 V with increasing Zn/Metal ratio of the film. However, the efficiency and short-circuit current density (JSC) steeply decreased when the Zn/Metal ratio of the film was more than 0.35. The elemental depth profiles and the electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) images showed that carriers excited in a Zn-rich layer near the surface were recombined in the film with the bulk Zn/Metal ratio of 0.4. These results suggest that the upper Zn-rich layer consists of n-type ZnSe and theJSCis decreased owing to carrier recombination.

280,Ultimate efficiency limit of single-junction perovskite and dual-junction perovskite/silicon two-terminal devices,"Theoretical calculation based on detailed balance and incorporating different realistic optical and electrical losses predicts conversion efficiency beyond 22% for single-junction perovskite devices. In dual-junction perovskite/silicon devices, theoretical conversion efficiency around 40% is been determined. However, dramatic drop in the conversion efficiency is shown to be due to the glass reflection and FTO parasitic absorption losses. Additionally, practical conversion efficiency limits of dual-junction two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell of 30% are achievable as reported in this work using state-of-the-art demonstrated devices. Additionally, various crystalline silicon (industry and laboratory demonstrated) technologies are used as the bottom cell for the current matched tandem cell stacks with higher relative improvements when using commercial c-Si solar cells.

In the SiNx:H film, it was shown that both exposure of the Si surface to FG plasma and FG annealing of the SiNx:H film dramatically decreased the surface recombination velocity,S, of the Si substrate, because of an improved Si/SiNx:H interface.

The average carrier lifetime of the mono-like Si is almost the same as that of the high-performance multicrystalline Si, and slightly shorter than that of the conventional multicrystalline Si. This would be caused by the higher density of metal contaminants owing to the longer process time for raw material melting. The density of dislocations and their clusters was significantly lower in the mono-like Si and high-performance multicrystalline Si than that in the conventional multicrystalline Si.

From the results of the floating cast method, the obtained microstructure of mc-Si was determined to contain unique microstructures, consisting of large faceted dendrites and small grains with low and high dislocation densities. The PDG efficiency was evaluated through the change in minority carrier lifetime. As a result, a stronger positive PDG effect was found for large faceted dendrites with low dislocation density, attributed to a small number of defects that can act as recombination centers of carriers. Lifetime improvement was also found in dislocation regions possibly owing to the redistribution of interstitial metals. These results suggest the importance of controlling the microstructure of mc-Si, which could strongly affect the PDG efficiency and existence of incorporated impurities.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KD11","Supawan Joonwichien, Isao Takahashi, Satoru Matsushima, Noritaka Usami","['Graduate School of Engineering, Sieu Pheng Phang, Peiting Zheng et al', 'Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan']",2015,The effect of phosphorus diffusion gettering on the differences in microstructures of multicrystalline silicon wafers was determined.,[],[],[],"['phosphorus gettering', 'effect phosphorus', 'phosphorus diffusion', 'phosphorus']",[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Graduate School of Engineering', 'Nagoya University']",0,"['(Graduate School of Engineering, 0)', '(Nagoya University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Performance of Solar Systems']"

In this study we demonstrate that AlOx/AlNxstacks fabricated by reactive radio-frequency magnetron sputtering can provide fairly good surface passivation (Smaxof ∼30 cm/s) regardless of AlOxthickness, which is found to be due to the high negative fixed charge density (Qeffof −2.8×1012cm−2) and moderately low interface trap density (Ditof 2.0×1011eV−1·cm−2).

297,Reliability of a printed Cu busbar electrode on a conventional silicon solar cell,"In this paper, we describe the reliability of the Cu busbar electrode fabricated by screen printing of resin-based Cu pastes on a crystal silicon solar cell with conventional front and rear electrodes excluding the busbar. The damp heat test (DHT) and thermal cycling test (TCT) of the cells were carried out with ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and glass encapsulation, and without any encapsulation. No significant degradation was observed for either case. Oxidation was confined to the surface region even without encapsulation after 2,500 h of DHT. Cu diffusion into Si was evaluated using pseudo fill factor (pFF). No significant changes in pFF were found after heat treatment (400 °C, 1 h) in the case of resin-based Cu, where 10% pFF loss was observed when Cu was introduced by vapor deposition. From these findings, the role of resin used as a binder in Cu pastes is considered a key material parameter of Cu diffusion in Si.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KD22","Hideo Tokuhisa, Shogo Ise, Satoko Morita, Shiho Tsukamoto, Mitsuru Tomita, Manabu Yoshida","['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan']",2015,"In this paper, we describe the reliability of the Si busbar electrode fabricated by screen printing of resin-based Si pastes on a crystal silicon solar cell with conventional front and rear electrodes excluding the busbar.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology'],1,"['(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

The triple-junction cells can be used as top cells for smart stacked multijunction solar cells. A growth temperature of 480 °C was found to be suitable for an (In)AlGaAs second cell to obtain high-quality tunnel junctions.

As for the feasibility of this system, a prototype with a holding capacity of 25 compact solar-pumped lasers has been fabricated. The primary requisite of this system is that the angular accuracy of tracking should be below 1 mrad for all 25 compact solar-pumped lasers to sustain their continuous lasing.

We studied the adsorption efficiencies of As2and P2to determine the optimal parameters for the growth of lattice-matched In0.81Ga0.19As0.43P0.57by SS-MBE. The adsorption efficiency of As2was found to be seven times greater than that of P2, and lattice-matched In0.81Ga0.19AsyP1−y(y= 0.43) can be achieved at a PAs/(PP+ PAs) ratio of ∼0.10. Then, we studied the effect of growth temperature on the characteristics of lattice-matched In0.81Ga0.19As0.43P0.57single-junction solar cells.

315,Insertion effects of interlayers for efficient polymer-based organic solar cells,"We report the improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) by introducing an organic–inorganic hybrid interlayer, which was composed of C60as an n-type semiconductor and lithium fluoride (LiF) as metal fluoride between a thienothiophene-benzodithiophene based polymer (PTB7):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) photoactive layer and an Al electrode. An additional C60layer in the C60/LiF interlayer improves charge carrier collection from a photoactive layer to an Al electrode. In addition, the contact between PTB7 as a p-type semiconducting polymer in the photoactive layer and the C60layer in the C60/LiF interlayer increases the number of photo produced charge carrier sites. These effects increases the short-circuit current density compared with that in the case of a solar cell with a conventional LiF interlayer. On the other hand, the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the solar cell with the C60/LiF interlayer are the same as those of the solar cell with a conventional LiF interlayer. By optimizing the thickness of the C60layer, a maximum PCE of 6.76% was obtained with a C60layer thickness of 3 nm in the C60/LiF interlayer.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KF05","Tetsuya Taima, Jun Tanaka, Takayuki Kuwabara, Kohshin Takahashi","['Research Center for Sustainable Energy and Technology, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan', 'Science and Technology Agency (JST), Kawaguchi, Japan', 'Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan', 'JST-PRESTO, Japan']",2015,"The improvement of power conversion efficiency by introducing an organic–inorganic hybrid interlayer, which was composed of C60as an n-type semiconductor and lithium fluoride as metal fluoride between a thienothiophene-benzodithiophene based polymer photoactive layer and an AC electrode.",[],[],[],"['lithium fluoride', 'lithium', 'semiconductor lithium']",[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Kanazawa University', 'Science and Technology Agency', 'Kanazawa University', 'Japan Science and Technology Agency']",2,"['(Kanazawa University, 0)', '(Science and Technology Agency, 1)', '(Kanazawa University, 0)', '(Japan Science and Technology Agency, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

319,Relationship between cross-linking conditions of ethylene vinyl acetate and potential induced degradation for crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules,"In this study, we investigated the relationship in crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic (PV) modules between the cross-linking level of copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate (EVA) as the encapsulant and the degree of degradation due to potential induced degradation (PID) phenomenon. We used three methods for the determination of cross-linking level of EVA: xylene method, which is one of the solvent extraction methods (SEM), curing degree by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and viscoelastic properties by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The results indicate that degradation of PV modules by PID test depends on the cross-linking level of EVA. The PV modules encapsulated by EVA with higher cross-linking level show lower degradation degree due to PID phenomenon. Also we showed that EVA with higher cross-linking level tended to be higher volume resistivity. This tendency is similar to that for electrical resistance value during the PID test. The PID test was also done by changing thickness of EVA between front cover glass and c-Si with the same cross-linking level. The PV modules encapsulated by thicker EVA between front cover glass and c-Si cell show lower degradation by PID. From these results, the PV modules encapsulated by EVA with higher cross-linking level, higher volume resistivity and increased thickness would be tolerant of PID phenomenon.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KG01","Sachiko Jonai, Kohjiro Hara, Yuji Tsutsui, Hidenari Nakahama, Atsushi Masuda","['Nisshinbo Holdings Inc, Okazaki, Japan', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tosu, Japan']",2015,A crystalline silicon photovoltaic module encapsulated by copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate as the encapsulant and the degree of degradation due to potential induced degradation phenomenon.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Nisshinbo Holdings Inc', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology']",1,"['(Nisshinbo Holdings Inc, 1)', '(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

322,Non-contact measurement of electric potential of photovoltaic cells in a module and novel characterization technologies,"A novel noncontact method of measuring the electric potential of component cells in photovoltaic (PV) modules is investigated using electrostatic field measurement technology. Experimental results for various kinds of PV cells and modules are presented, and their measurement principle as well as practical factors that affect the measurement results are discussed. It is demonstrated that the DC electric potential of the cells in various crystalline silicon and thin-film PV modules can be measured indoors through their cover glass or backsheet within a resolution of the output voltage of about 1 cell. The method is also applicable to the outdoor measurement of PV modules under grid-connected operation, and enables various kinds of characterization such as identifying low-performance cells in a PV module and degraded modules in a PV array, and determining the balance of their output current under outdoor operating conditions. Different distributions of electric potential measured from the front and back surfaces are observed for some types of modules. These differences are suggested, by the results of the analysis of experiments and numerical simulations, to originate from the modification of the module's surface electric potential by slight current flow through its component materials such as the cover glass, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), and backsheet.https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KG05","Yoshihiro Hishikawa, Kengo Yamagoe, Tsuyoshi Onuma","['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan']",2015,A novel noncontact method of measuring the electric potential of component cells in photovoltaic modules is investigated using electrostatic field measurement technology.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology'],1,"['(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Performance of Solar Systems']"

Fast sweep speeds suppressed the irradiance variation. As a result, smoothI–Vcurves were obtained and the PV parameter deviation was suppressed. The module's temperature was measured by attaching resistive temperature detector sensors on the module's backsheet. The PV sensor was measured synchronously with the PV module. The PV parameters includingIsc,Pmax,Voc, andFFwere estimated after correcting theI–Vcurves using the IEC standards. The reproducibility ofIsc,Pmax,Voc, andFFrelative to the outdoor fits was evaluated as 0.43, 0.58, 0.24, and 0.23%, respectively.

324,Acceleration of potential-induced degradation by salt-mist preconditioning in crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules,"We examined the sequential effects of salt-mist stress followed by high-system-voltage stress on the power loss of crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules to determine whether a crucial failure as potential-induced degradation (PID) is accelerated by material-property changes caused by the long-term effects of a less harmful stress such as salt-mist spraying. Degradation profiles confirmed in this study show that PID is accelerated by certain types of salt-mist preconditioning. For the acceleration of PID, the contribution of sodium ions liberated from the front glass of the PV module seems to be excluded. Therefore, we consider that the sodium ions penetrating into the PV modules from the ambient environment may also cause degradation according to the proposed mechanisms of PID, as the sodium ions existing in the front glass cause PID. Furthermore, this type of degradation may indicate the wear-out phenomenon after a long-term exposure in the field (especially near the coast).https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.54.08KG08","Soh Suzuki, Naoki Nishiyama, Seiji Yoshino, Takumi Ujiro, Shin Watanabe, Takuya Doi, Atsushi Masuda, Tadanori Tanahashi","['Development Headquarters, ESPEC Corporation, Tsukuba, Japan', 'Research Center for Photovoltaics, Module Reliability Research Team, Tsukuba, Japan', 'Solution Division, JFE Techno-Research Corporation, Chiba, Japan', 'Research Center for Photovoltaic Technologies, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tosu, Japan', 'Reliability-Testing Headquarters, Tsukuba, Japan', 'Photovoltaic Business Division, NPC Inc, Matsuyama, Japan']",2015,A potential-induced degradation is accelerated by material-property changes caused by the long-term effects of a less harmful stress such as salt-mist spraying.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['ESPEC Corporation', 'Research Center for Photovoltaics', 'JFE Techno-Research Corporation', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology', 'Reliability-Testing Headquarters', 'NPC Inc']",2,"['(ESPEC Corporation, 1)', '(Research Center for Photovoltaics, 0)', '(JFE Techno-Research Corporation, 1)', '(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)', '(Reliability-Testing Headquarters, 1)', '(NPC Inc, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

The design of the water and gasoline engine pumping system were evaluated. The gasoline fuel cost used in rice cultivation in an area of 1.6 acres. Under same conditions of water pumping system is replaced by the photovoltaic system which is composed of a solar panel, a converter and an electric motor pump which is compose of a direct current (DC) motor or an alternating current (AC) motor with an inverter. In addition, the battery is installed to increase the efficiency and productivity of rice cultivation. In order to verify, the simulation and economic evaluation of the storage energy battery system with batteries and without batteries are carried out. Finally the cost of four solar pumping systems was evaluated and compared with that of the gasoline pump. The results showed that the solar pumping system can be used to replace the gasoline water pumping system and DC solar pump has a payback less than 10 years. The systems that can payback the fastest is the DC solar pumping system without batteries storage system.

329,Advanced Modelling of Silicon Wafer Solar Cells,"Modelling of solar cells today is general practice in research and widely-used in industry. Established modelling software is typically limited to one dimension and/or to small scales. Additionally, novel effects, like, e.g., the use of diffractive structures or luminescent materials, are not established. In this paper we discuss how the combination of different modelling techniques can be used to overcome these limitations. In this context two examples are presented. The first example concerns the combination of the open source simulation software PC1D with circuit modelling to investigate the effect of local shunts on the global characteristics of a silicon wafer solar cell. For the investigated example (4.5 cm2cell area) we find that a local point shunt reduces the solar cell efficiency by 4% relative. The second example concerns the modelling of diffractive gratings for thin silicon wafer solar cells. For this purpose, we use the rigorous coupled wave analysis to simulate Sentaurus technical computer-aided design (TCAD) is combined with the rigorous coupled wave analysis, a method to solve Maxwell's equations for periodic structures.

The etch rate strongly depended on the surface temperature. The optimum temperature for the etching at high rate was about 70 °C. With increasing the temperature higher than 70 °C, decrease in etch rate was observed, and activation energy for the reaction process was estimated to be about -1.8 kcal/mol. This value agreed well with the result of the previous studies using low-pressure plasma conditions. In addition, hydrogen concentration was also affected by the surface temperature. The reduction in hydrogen concentration near the surface was observed in the etched sample at higher temperature. From these results, reaction mechanism causing the decrease in etch rate with the temperature increase has been discussed in terms of both desorption and in-diffusion of hydrogen from the surface.https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.51.10NA09","Takahiro Yamada, Hiromasa Ohmi, Kohei Okamoto, Hiroaki Kakiuchi, Kiyoshi Yasutake","['Department of Precision Science and Technology, Osaka University, Suita, Japan', 'Research Center for Ultra-Precision Science and Technology, Osaka University, Suita, Japan', 'Japan Science and Technology Agency, Chiyoda, Japan']",2012,A method of etching silicon by narrow-gap microwave hydrogen plasma is described.

RIE texturing produced a deep and narrow textured surface with an excellent low reflectance. Owing to plasma-induced damage, unless the RIE-textured surface is subjected to proper damage removal etching (DRE), it shows drops in open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). RIE-textured samples with proper DRE showed sufficiently higher short circuit current (Isc) than acid-textured samples without a drop inVoc. In this study, we applied RIE texturing under optimized DRE condition to the selective emitter structure.

Zn-doped ITO films were fabricated by rf magnetron sputtering of ITO and Al-doped ZnO (AZO) targets on corning glass at room temperature. The content of Zn increased with increasing the power of AZO target. The carrier concentration of films shows the decreasing behaviour with increasing the content of Zn, due to a carrier compensation originating from the substitution of a doped Zn for an In or interstitial site. After the low-temperature annealing at 180 °C in vacuum, all films were slightly decreased a carrier concentration and increased the hall mobility because of the absorption of oxygen on the surface films. In addition, the average transmittance did not show a considerable change and had a high values over 80%.

Many additives were adapted to replace IPA, such as high boiling point alcohols. In this experiment, as a new attempt, sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS), a type of anionic surfactant, was used as the additive in NaOH solution. The etching properties of silicon in 2 wt % NaOH/15–30 mg/L SDS solution were analyzed. To improve the wettability of silicon, two types of metal salt, NaCl and Na2CO3with concentration from 2 to 15 wt %, were applied to the 2 wt % NaOH/15 mg/L SDS solution.

Although the deposition rate is lower (0.1–0.3 Å/s) than that of the conventional diode PECVD process, the light-soaking stability of the solar cell is markedly improved and less sensitive to the cell thickness due to the reduced Si–H2bond density in the a-Si:H i-layer. The a-Si:H single-junction solar cells exhibit low light-induced degradation of conversion efficiency (Δη/ηini∼10%) in comparison with that of high-efficiency solar cells reported to date. By applying the improved a-Si:H layers as top-cell absorbers in a-Si:H/hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (µc-Si:H) tandem device, the light-induced degradation can be reduced even further (Δη/ηini\lesssim5%).

The X-ray pole figure measurement shows that the BaSi2films grown on vicinal substrates as well as the on-axis substrate consist of three epitaxial variants which are equivalent in terms of 60° in-plane rotations, and that one of the variants is dominant in the film grown on the 2°-inclined substrate. The orientation maps produced by electron backscatter diffraction show that the domains with thebaxis parallel to the miscut direction are larger than the others in the film grown on the 2°-inclined substrate, while the domain sizes of three variants are found similar in the films grown on the on-axis and 4°-inclined substrates. The possible origin of the large domain formation is discussed with the focus on the initial growth stage observed by atomic force microscopy.

In this paper we present the optical and morphological properties of borosilicate glass superstrates textured with the aluminium induced texture (AIT) method. High haze values are achieved without any reduction in the total optical transmission of the glass sheets after the AIT process. Scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements reveal a laterally uniform surface morphology of the AIT texture. We demonstrate that the surface roughness and thus the transmission haze can be controlled by adjusting the AIT process parameters. From the AFM images, we extract histograms of the local height and angle distributions of the texture. Samples with a wide angle distribution are shown to produce the highest optical haze. The results of this analysis provide a better understanding of the correlation between the AIT process parameters and the resulting surface morphology.

Unlike the case of using chemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) hydrogenated a-Si films as precursors, no peeling of Si films occurs even in the absence of Cr adhesion layers. Such a flash-lamp-induced crystallization occurs also in doped EB-evaporated a-Si films as in the case of undoped films. The p+/p-/n+stacked structure is sufficiently kept even after crystallization, although the profiles of dopants are slightly modified. This fact clearly indicates that the crystallization observed is not based on liquid-phase epitaxy (LPE) after the complete melting of the whole a-Si precursor during millisecond-order treatment but through LPE-based explosive crystallization (EC), self-catalytic lateral crystallization driven by the release of latent heat. The formation of poly-Si films with large grains and the sufficient preservation of dopant profiles would lead to the utilization of the poly-Si films formed for solar cell devices.https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.51.10NB15","Keisuke Ohdaira, Keisuke Sawada, Noritaka Usami, Sergey Varlamov, Hideki Matsumura","['Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan', 'PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Kawaguchi, Japan', 'University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia', 'Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Nomi, Japan']",2012,The flash lamp annealing of electron-beam- evaporated amorphous silicon films results in the formation of polycrystalline Si films with at least a few m long grains stretching along lateral crystallization directions.,"['amorphous silicon', 'polycrystalline silicon']",[],[],[],[],[],[],"['JP', 'AU']","['AUS', 'JPN']","['Tohoku University', 'Japan Science and Technology Agency', 'University of New South Wales', 'Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology']",2,"['(Tohoku University, 0)', '(Japan Science and Technology Agency, 1)', '(University of New South Wales, 0)', '(Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

In the E-shape profiling, theJscof the a-SiGe:H cell is enhanced without significant losses inVoc. For further analysis, a modified E-shape profiling is incorporated in a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H double-junction cells, which has resulted in the improvement ofVocand FF of double-junction cells to 1.67 V and 0.753, respectively, without significant reduction inJscSiGeQE, 12.58 mA/cm2.https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.51.10NB16","Jin-Won Chung, Jun Woong Park, Yu Jin Lee, Seh-Won Ahn, Heon-Min Lee, O Ok Park","['Department of Energy Systems Engineering, Daegu, Republic of Korea', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea', 'Materials and Components R&D Laboratory, LG Electronics Advanced Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea']",2012,An amorphous silicon–germanium solar cell is fabricated with different thicknesses of the i/n graded layer and profiling shapes for appropriate band gap profiling.,['amorphous silicon'],[],[],"['silicon germanium', 'germanium']",[],[],[],['KR'],['KOR'],"['Daegu', 'Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology', 'LG Electronics']",2,"['(Daegu, 0)', '(Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 0)', '(LG Electronics, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
349,CuInSe2-Based Thin-Film Photovoltaic Technology in the Gigawatt Production Era,"The objective of this paper is to review current status and future prospect on CuInSe2(CIS)-based thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technology. In CIS-based thin-film PV technology, total-area cell efficiency in a small-area (i.e., smaller than 1 cm2) solar cell with top grids has been over 20%, while aperture-area efficiency in a large-area (i.e., larger than 800 cm2as definition) monolithic module is approaching to an 18% milestone. However, most of the companies with CIS-based thin-film PV technology still stay at a production research stage, except Solar Frontier K.K. In July, 2011, Solar Frontier has joined the gigawatt (GW) group by starting up their third facility with a 0.9-GW/year production capacity.

Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurement revealed that the band profile of CIGS films with high Ga content had a deep notch around 0.5 µm from the CdS/CIGS interface. In order to decrease the notch depth of the CIGS with high Ga content, the five-stage method was employed instead of the conventional three-stage method. As a result, we successfully obtained the efficiency of 14.9% using the CIGS absorber with an average band gap of 1.40 eV prepared by the five-stage method.

Although the device properties were believed to be the same we observed substantial deviations of the respective values of the open circuit voltage (ΔVOC= 40 mV) and of the fill factor (ΔFF= 4%), whereas the short circuit current was essentially the same. We performed fundamental device analysis, space charge and defect spectroscopy, transient photoluminescence as well as in-depth profiling of the chemical gradients of the absorber films. Using the results from the experiments we set up a simulation baseline which allowed us to conclude that the apparent deviations can be related to the presence of deep recombination centers with different concentration within the CIGSe absorber as well as to variations of the band gap grading.https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.51.10NC07","Robin Knecht, Jürgen Parisi, Ingo Riedel, Raymund Schäffler, Bernhard Dimmler","['University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany', 'Wuerth Solar GmbH & Co.

However, the zinc compound buffer layers such as ZnS(O,OH) are prone to plasma-induced damage during the subsequent ZnO sputtering process. A process causing less damage such as metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is thus required for ZnO-based transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layers. In the present work, the boron-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:B) films were grown by MOCVD using diethyl zinc (DEZ), H2O, and low-toxicity triethylboron (TEB). An UV-assisted MOCVD process was developed in order to reduce the resistivity of ZnO:B films. As a result, the resisitivity significantly decreased together with the increased electron mobility and carrier concentration. The comparison of performance was also carried out for the ZnS(O,OH)/CIGS solar cells with MOCVD-deposited ZnO:B and sputter-deposited ZnO:Al window layers.https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.51.10NC09","Taizo Kobayashi, Kotaro Yamauchi, Takahiro Mise, Tokio Nakada","['Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Aoyama Gakuin University, Sagamihara, Japan']",2012,"In the present work, the boron-doped zinc oxide films were grown by chemical vapor deposition using diethyl zinc , H2O, and low-toxicity triethylboron .",[],[],[],"['zinc oxide', 'zinc', 'boron-doped zinc', 'diethyl zinc']",[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['Aoyama Gakuin University'],0,"['(Aoyama Gakuin University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

Zn(O,S) has an advantage in the control of the CBO because the conduction band minimum can be controlled by S/(S+O) compositional ratios. The efficiency of the CIS solar cells with the Zn(O,S) window layers increased with increasing S/(S+O) ratio from 0.19 to 0.50. However, the efficiency decreased at the S/(S+O) ratio of 0.59 owing to the decrease in the fill factor because of the double-diode-like behavior. The maximum efficiency was obtained at the S/(S+O) ratio of 0.50.

355,First-Principles Study on Cd Doping in Cu2ZnSnS4and Cu2ZnSnSe4,"To quantitatively evaluate the substitution energies of Cd atom for Cu, Zn, or Sn atom in indium-free photovoltaic semiconductors Cu2ZnSnS4(CZTS) and Cu2ZnSnSe4(CZTSe), first-principles pseudopotential calculations using plane-wave basis functions were performed. The substitution energies of Cd atom in kesterite-type CZTS and CZTSe were calculated in consideration of the atomic chemical potentials of the constituent elements of Cu, Zn, Sn, and the doping atom of Cd. During the chemical bath deposition (CBD) of the CdS layer on the CZTS or CZTSe layer, Cu, Zn, and Cd atoms dissolved in the ammonia aqueous solution and formed [Cu(NH3)2]+, [Zn(NH3)4]2+, and [Cd(NH3)4]2+complex ions. Therefore, the chemical potentials of Cu, Zn, and Cd atoms in [Cu(NH3)2]+, [Zn(NH3)4]2+, and [Cd(NH3)4]2+complex ions were calculated. We found that the substitution energies of n-type CdCuand charge-neutral CdZnin CZTS and CZTSe are smaller than that of p-type CdSn. The substitution energies of CdCuin CZTS and CZTSe are smaller than that in chalcopyrite-type CuInSe2(CIS). However, the substitution energies of CdCu, CdZn, and CdSnare positive values. The formation energy of charge-neutral Cd doping with the Cu vacancy (CdCu+ VCu) pair is a negative value and greatly smaller than those of donor-type CdCuand neutral CdZnin CZTS and CZTSe. These results indicate that the charge-neutral (CdCu+ VCu) vacancy pair is easily formed during the CBD of the CdS layer on the CZTS or CZTSe layer.

Measurements have been done just after the respective cell process for the preparation of the Al/ZnO:Al/ZnO/CdS/CIGS structure, in which CdS has been formed by the chemical-bath deposition (CBD) while undoped and Al-doped ZnO layers were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering. PL intensity does not change by depositions of CdS and undoped ZnO buffer layers. PL intensity decreases by the deposition of the ZnO:Al film due to the cell shunt at the edge. The electrical cell isolation by the mechanical scribing leads to the increase in PL intensity because of the formation of the hetero-junction under the open circuit condition. The decay curves of the as deposited CIGS film, CdS/CIGS and ZnO/CdS/CIGS are non-exponential and composed of dominant fast decay and weak slow decay components. After the ZnO:Al deposition, PL decay is represented by the single exponential curve with long decay time. They are discussed in terms of the junction formation.

The band-gap energy (Eg) of the Zn(O,S) layer estimated by optical transmission and reflection measurements was varied from 3.2 to 3.6 eV. The solar cells with sulfur (S)-poor Zn(O,S) buffer layers showed a low open-circuit voltage (VOC) owing to the cliff nature of the conduction band offset (CBO). In contrast, the solar cells with S-rich Zn(O,S) buffer layers showed a low short-circuit current density (JSC) owing to the spike nature of CBO. Even if the CBO values were adequate, the best solar cell efficiencies were considerably low.

This may influence surface energies, and consequently the growth mechanism. We investigated the relation between the orientation of Cu(In,Ga)S2films and pressure during deposition. We varied the background pressure during the deposition of the precursor film (first stage) by varying the temperature of the sulphur source, by throttling the vacuum pump, or by introducing N2gas.

The objective of this study is to elucidate the effects of n or p type MoS2on the overall CZTS solar cell performance. Energy band line-up of Mo/MoS2/CZTS interface is analyzed to elucidate the interface properties. It is found out that p-MoS2layer in CZTS solar cell induces the same adventitious effect as p-MoSe2in CIGS solar cell. However, n-MoS2layer has detrimental effect on the CZTS solar cell by creating an additional back contact diode with p-CZTS layer and an ohmic contact with Mo layer. Thickness, bandgap energy and carrier concentration of n-MoS2all have been varied in the numerical simulation to observe its effects on the cell performance parameters. The results from numerical simulation show that MoS2layer as thin as 50 nm is sufficient enough to induce adverse effect on the solar cell performance. This could be caused by the increase in series resistance of the solar cell as n-type MoS2would inhibit hole current into Mo back contact due to the hole barrier between n-type MoS2and Mo back contact. The increase in MoS2bandgap and carrier concentration also results in detrimental effect to the performance of the cell mainly due to the possibility of electrons to drift towards the back contact and recombine.https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.51.10NC32","Puvaneswaran Chelvanathan, Mohammad Istiaque Hossain, Jamilah Husna, Mohammad Alghoul, Kamaruzzaman Sopian, Nowshad Amin","['Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia', 'Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia', 'CEREM, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia']",2012,"This study demonstrates the effects of transition metal dichalcogenide, SiO2layer formation in between the copper–zinc–tin–sulphide absorber layer and Si back contact from theoretical study and numerical modeling.",[],[],[],"['copper zinc', 'zinc', 'copper', 'formation copper', 'tin sulphide', 'zinc tin', 'tin', 'sulfur', 'molybdenum']",[],[],[],"['SA', 'MY']","['SAU', 'MYS']","['Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia', 'Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia', 'King Saud University']",0,"['(Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 0)', '(Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 0)', '(King Saud University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

383,Effect of Quantum Well on the Efficiency of Carrier Collection in InGaAs/GaAsP Multiple Quantum Well Solar Cells,"For a quantitative evaluation of the carrier transport dynamics of multiple quantum well (MQW) solar cells, carrier collection efficiency (CCE) was defined and its measurement procedure was proposed.CCEis essentially the quantum efficiency normalized to the saturation value at a reverse bias. It allows us to know whether substantial carriers are actually extracted at any bias voltage, and to uncover the bottleneck problems of carrier transport that emerge at the operation bias. The advantage ofCCEanalysis is that the dynamics of photoexcited carriers can be selectively examined independently of the diode characteristics of the devices if the effects of resistance are small enough. In the present study, GaAs p–i–n solar cells including various numbers of InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs with a band gap of 1.2 eV in the i-region of equal thickness were fabricated and characterized. Interfered carrier transport by increasing the well number was quantitatively and directly evaluated. With up to 30 periods of MQWs, the carriers generated, especially in the wells, were less likely to be collected than those generated in the top p-region at a moderate forward bias, but collection of both was found to be degraded severely with 40 periods of MQWs.https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.51.10ND04","Hiromasa Fujii, Kentaroh Watanabe, Masakazu Sugiyama, Yoshiaki Nakano","['Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Japan', 'Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Meguro, Japan']",2012,"A quantitative evaluation of the carrier transport dynamics of multiple quantum well solar cells, carrier collection efficiency was defined and its measurement procedure was proposed.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['The University of Tokyo', 'The University of Tokyo']",0,"['(The University of Tokyo, 0)', '(The University of Tokyo, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Performance of Solar Systems']"

It is found that the capacitance under illumination increases sharply if the bias is raised above -0.2 V, and gets maximum at a bias of about 0.2 V. This increment in capacitance by the illumination is ascribed to the reduction of the depletion layer thickness, caused by the spatially separated accumulation of photogenerated electrons and holes trapped in the MQW layer.https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.51.10ND07","Takeshi Noda, Takaaki Mano, Masafumi Jo, Yi Ding, Takuya Kawazu, Hiroyuki Sakaki","['National Institute for Materials Science, Tsukuba, Japan', 'Toyota Technological Institute, Nagoya, Japan']",2012,"The increment in capacitance by the illumination is ascribed to the reduction of the depletion layer thickness, caused by the spatially separated accumulation of photogenerated electrons and holes trapped in the GaAs layer.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['National Institute for Materials Science', 'Toyota Technological Institute']",1,"['(National Institute for Materials Science, 1)', '(Toyota Technological Institute, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Performance of Solar Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

By analyzing curvature transients, we found that an inadequate gas-switching sequence induces the carry over of indium from the InGaAs layer to the overlying GaAs insertion layer. The resulting carry-over layer has an estimated thickness of 0.6 nm and adversely affects the average strain of the structure.

388,Barrier Thickness Dependence of Photovoltaic Characteristics of InGaN/GaN Multiple Quantum Well Solar Cells,"We discuss the influence of the barrier thickness of an InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) structure on solar cell performance. As barrier thickness decreases, short-circuit current density increases and open-circuit voltage decreases. The open-circuit voltage is much lower than expected from the absorption edge because of the large leakage current and large ideality factor of diodes owning to the carrier tunneling through the barrier. An MQW with a 3-nm-thick barrier layer shows a much longer carrier lifetime than that with a 9-nm-thick barrier layer. This is one possible reason for a higher short-circuit current in solar cell with the 3-nm-thick barrier MQW structure than that with the 9-nm-thick barrier MQW.https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.51.10ND10","Noriyuki Watanabe, Haruki Yokoyama, Naoteru Shigekawa, Ken-ichi Sugita, Akio Yamamoto","['NTT Photonics Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Atsugi, Japan', 'Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan', 'Graduate School of Engineering, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan']",2012,Disclosed is the influence of the barrier thickness of an InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well structure on solar cell performance.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation', 'Osaka City University', 'University of Fukui']",2,"['(Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, 1)', '(Osaka City University, 0)', '(University of Fukui, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy']"

393,Effects of Background Zn Doping on the Performance of InGaAs/GaAsP Multiple Quantum Well Solar Cells Grown by a Planetary Metal Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy Reactor,"The effects of background Zn doping on the performance of p–i–n GaAs solar cells with InGaAs/GaAsP multiple quantum wells (MQWs) in i-GaAs layer have been studied. The crystal growth was done by a planetary metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) reactor. The background Zn doping, in an order of 1017cm-3, degraded the solar cell efficiency by modifying the energy band diagram in a way that obstructed carrier transports. It was shown by calculation that the carrier transports across the MQWs region suffered from decrease in built-in electric field in absorber layers, leading to an efficiency loss by radiative and nonradiative recombinations. Consequently, the external quantum efficiency and the current density of a Zn-contaminated MQW solar cell were terribly poor. Reactor baking at 850 °C for 20 min seems to remove Zn residues effectively without noticeable effects on the succeeding growth of MQW solar cells. The InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs fabricated in the thermally cleaned reactor have shown a potential to extend the absorption edge of GaAs solar cells and to improve the efficiency of multi-junction solar cells by current matching. Therefore, the growth of InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs by planetary MOVPE reactors requires a careful treatment regarding the background doping issue.https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.51.10ND15","Hassanet Sodabanlu, Shaojun Ma, Kentaroh Watanabe, Masakazu Sugiyama, Yoshiaki Nakano","['Institute of Engineering Innovation, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Japan', 'School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Japan', 'Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Meguro, Japan']",2012,A method for improving the efficiency of multi-junction solar cells by current matching and extending the absorption edge of single-junction solar cells is disclosed.,[],[],[],[],"['efficiency multi-junction', 'multi-junction solar', 'multi-junction', 'single-junction', 'single-junction solar']",[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['The University of Tokyo', 'The University of Tokyo', 'The University of Tokyo']",0,"['(The University of Tokyo, 0)', '(The University of Tokyo, 0)', '(The University of Tokyo, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

The p–i–n GaAs solar cells, containing 20-period InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs in an i-GaAs layer, were fabricated by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy. The strain inside MQWs was varied by changing In content in an InGaAs well, while maintaining other parameters. As evidenced by curvature transience, the excessive strain led to lattice relaxation, resulting in defects, dislocations, and poor crystal quality. Consequently, short circuit current density and open circuit voltage deteriorated, and solar cell performance degraded. The highest conversion efficiency was obtained in a strain-balanced MQW solar cell. InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs have a great potential for extending the absorption edge of GaAs cells and for enhancing the efficiency of III/V multijunction solar cells by current matching.

As a result, stable surface structures of GaAsN(001) under hydrogen (H) atmosphere were determined. In these structures, N is suggested to readily substitute into surface sites, especially those that bond with H, compared with in the bulk. This indicates that N is incorporated into a thin film together with H. This may generate H-related defects, which may lead to the degradation of its electric properties. These defects are difficult to minimize by post-annealing processes. Therefore, the amount of H attached to the growth surface should be reduced in order to obtain high-quality crystals.

The deuteration of TCNQ and TCNAQ significantly modifies the spectrum of vibronic coupling constants for many vibrational modes, but affects little the modes with the strongest contribution to IC.

Trapping sites of photogenerated hole carriers (positive polarons) are ascribed to P3HT by the analysis of the ESR signals.https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.51.10NE08","Kazuhiro Marumoto, Tatsuya Nagamori","['Institute of Materials Science, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan', 'Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), PRESTO, Japan']",2012,This invention relates to organic thin-film solar cells from the microscopic viewpoint with light-induced electron spin resonance .,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['University of Tsukuba', 'Japan Science and Technology Agency']",2,"['(University of Tsukuba, 0)', '(Japan Science and Technology Agency, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
402,Doping of Silicon Quantum Dots Embedded in Nitride Matrix for All-Silicon Tandem Cells,"Boron (B)- and antimony (Sb)-doped Si quantum dots (QDs) in Si3N4films were fabricated using the co-sputtering method with a post-deposition anneal. The effect of B and Sb on Si QDs films was investigated in terms of structural, optical and electrical properties. It is found that a low dopant concentration induced negligible structural changes in the Si QD films. The PL intensity decreases with increasing B or Sb content. This could result from the non-radiative recombination processes attributed to defects associated with the dopants and Auger processes due to successful doping of Si QDs. For the B-doped sample the conductivity increases about 100 times, which could be attributed to an increase in carrier concentration. For the Sb-doped sample, a significant increase (six orders of magnitude) in conductivity suggests an effective Sb doping. The charge transport mechanism in the Sb-doped Si QD films matches well with the percolation-hopping model in low temperature region. Both B- and Sb-doped samples show thermally activated hopping conduction characteristics in the range of 220–320 K.https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.51.10NE10","Shujuan Huang, Yong Heng So, Gavin Conibeer, Martin Green","['ARC Photovoltaics Centre of Excellence, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia']",2012,The present invention relates to the doping of Si quantum dots with one or more dopants selected from the group consisting of Al and Sb.,[],[],['quantum dots'],[],[],[],[],['AU'],['AUS'],['University of New South Wales'],0,"['(University of New South Wales, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Performance of Solar Systems']"

The EWG possessing smaller dihedral angle between the EWG and dye skeleton exhibited larger bathochromic shift in absorptions.

In contrast, highly distortedo- andp-nitrophenyl groups exhibited blue-shifted absorption at 416 and 422, respectively; however, despite of resemble spectral properties,o- andp-nitrophenyl gave second best and the worst conversion efficiencies of 4.05 and 2.51%, respectively.

The difference in QFL of TiO2under short circuit and open circuit are also analyzed. It is found that the QFL difference between the electrolyte side of the TiO2film and the equilibrium redox potential, as well as the QFL difference between the two sides of the TiO2film shift to higher potential owing to the addition of TBP to the electrolyte. The shift values are influenced by the cations present in the electrolyte.

The photovoltaic characteristics, namely, open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor, and energy conversion efficiency, of DSSCs with 0.3 wt % Cu2O doping in the photoanode are 690 mV, 4.55 mA/cm2, 52.0%, and 1.96%, respectively. The photovoltaic parameters of the sample with 0.3 wt % Cu2O doping are better than those of other Cu2O-doped samples, which are inferior to undoped TiO2-based DSSCs. The measured cell performance shows that the addition of Cu2O to the TiO2photoanode in DSSCs results in the reduction of photovoltaic parameters. The degradation mechanism upon Cu2O doping in the TiO2photoanode of DSSCs may be attributed to the variations in the valence numbers of copper and titanium ions during calcination and the reduction–oxidation reaction, resulting in the formation of oxygen vacancy–Ti+3defects and related recombination centers.https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.51.10NE18","Horng-Show Koo, Der-Tsuey Wang, Yi-Kuei Yu, Shao-Hung Ho, Jia-Yu Jhang, Mi Chen, Ming-Fong Tai","['Department of Physics, National Tsing-Hua University, Hsinchu Taiwan', 'Department of Optoelectronic System Engineering, Minghsin University of Science and Technology, Xinfeng Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C', 'Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Minghsin University of Science and Technology, Xinfeng Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C']",2012,A method for improving the photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells by doping the photoanode with Si2O.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['TW'],['TWN'],"['National Tsing-Hua University', 'Minghsin University of Science and Technology', 'Minghsin University of Science and Technology']",0,"['(National Tsing-Hua University, 0)', '(Minghsin University of Science and Technology, 0)', '(Minghsin University of Science and Technology, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy']"

The dye sensitized solar cells fabricated with 40 nm thick TiO2passivation layer showed the maximum power conversion efficiency of 6.93%. It was due to the effective connection of mesoporous TiO2and FTO and the prevention of electron recombination from the FTO to electrolyte.

On the other hand, buried grid module proposed in this work is possible to be stably sealed with only one layer of sealant. In this structure, grid electrodes are leveled with the same height of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) because grid electrodes are inserted under furrows of etched TCOs.

When a 15 nm ZnO layer was inserted between the active layer (P3HT:PCBM) and Al electrode, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was increased by approximately 10% as compared to that without ZnO layer. From the systematic analysis of the current–voltage and impedance characteristics of devices with and without the ZnO layer at various temperatures and light intensities, we found that the device with the ZnO layer has a lower activation energy for carrier extraction and bimolecular recombination loss compared with that without the ZnO layer.

The average photon energies of the diffuse spectra were changed largely by the cloud cover in contrast to the little dependence in the direct spectra, which confirms the importance of separate observations. Spectral models describing the effects of clouds on the direct and diffuse spectra were derived; these models were demonstrated by regression analyses of the observations.

440,Sintering and reorganization of electrochemically etched mesoporous germanium layers in various atmospheres,"We investigate sintering and reorganization of electrochemically etched mesoporous Ge layers. Sintering in nitrogen, forming gas, or argon atmospheres always yields a reorganized and oxidized porous layer. Water-insoluble Ge native oxides produced during etching do not hinder thermal reorganization, but evolve to water soluble oxides during annealing. Reorganized porous layers hence dissolve in subsequent water or HF dips. Sintering in hydrogen atmospheres removes native Ge oxides and prevents oxidation of porous layers. Porous layers with porosities less than 30% exhibit a compact closed surface after sintering, whereas porous layers with porosities exceeding 50% collapse. The porosity decreases linearly in a range of 57%–45% for electrolyte concentrations and in a range of 35–50wt% for a specific resistivity of 0.013Ωcm and an etching current density of 5mAcm−2. We obtain porosities below 30% by using substrate resistivities in the 0.015–0.030Ωcm range, etching current densities below 2.5mAcm−2 and an electrolyte concentration of HF 50wt%.","E Rojas, J Hensen, C Baur, R Brendel","['European Space Agency -ESTEC, Noordwijk Emmerthal, The Netherlands Germany', 'Institut für Solarenergieforschung Hameln (ISFH), Emmerthal, Germany']",2011,The invention relates to a method for sintering and reorganization of electrochemically etched mesoporous Si layers.,[],[],[],['germanium'],[],[],[],"['DE', 'NL']","['DEU', 'NLD']","['European Space Agency', 'Institut für Solarenergieforschung Hameln']",1,"['(European Space Agency, 1)', '(Institut für Solarenergieforschung Hameln, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

442,The novel usage of spectroscopic ellipsometry for the development of amorphous Si solar cells,"We present the novel use of spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) for the development of a-Si:H solar cell. SE is a very fast and useful tool to measure various optical properties of thin film. In the case of a-Si:H thin film analysis, generally, SE is used to estimate the film thickness, roughness, void fraction, optical constants such as (n,k), and so forth. In this study, optical parameters from SE measurements were analyzed with relation to structural and electrical properties of a-Si:H thin film for solar cell. By analyzing IR absorption spectra and conductivity measurements, it was affirmed that <ε2> and parameter A by Tauc–Lorentz model fitting of SE data are representative parameters qualifying a-Si:H thin film, and that they have close relationships with FF and light induced degradation property of solar cells. Based on the analysis, solar cells that have i-layers with various Eg were optimized.

444,Influence of oxygen on the sputtering of aluminum oxide for the surface passivation of crystalline silicon,"While sputtering has been shown to be capable of depositing aluminum oxide suitable for surface passivation, the mechanisms for this are yet to be firmly established and its potential realized. In this paper, we investigate the relationships between the oxygen in the sputtering process to the resulting composition of the deposited film and the surface passivation obtained. We find that surface passivation is not strongly dependent on the bulk composition of the film. Instead the results indicate that the interfacial silicon oxide layer that forms after annealing between the aluminum oxide film and the silicon is a much more important factor; it is this combined structure of aluminum oxide, silicon oxide and silicon that is crucial for obtaining negative charges and excellent surface passivation.","Yves Mansoulie ´d, Mario Tucci, Christian Samundsett, Tsu-Tsung Li, Simona De Iullis, Luca Serenelli, Andres Cuevas, Simon Ruffell","['Research Center Casaccia, ENEA, Roma, Italy', 'E ´cole Centrale Paris, Châtenay-Malabry, France', 'Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physical Sciences & Engineering, Canberra, Australia', 'School of Engineering, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia']",2011,A method for depositing aluminum oxide suitable for surface passivation is disclosed.

In order to resolve the discrepancy, we investigate the temperature coefficients of a-Si modules by two different methods corresponding to two different time scales. The results are that the temperature coefficient for a shorter time scale of several hours is negative, although the temperature coefficient for a longer time scale of seasons is positive. These results suggest that the discrepancy in temperature coefficient is partially caused by the effects of thermal annealing and light soaking. Therefore, the history of module temperature and received solar irradiance would be required for the correction of the performance of a-Si modules. In addition, we reveal that the effect of solar spectrum is also a contributory factor in the discrepancy.","Kenji Otani, Shinji Kawai, Tetsuyuki Ishii, Takumi Takashima","['Department of Earth and Planetary Science, The University of Tokyo, Hongo Tokyo, Japan', 'The Research Center for Photovoltaics, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan']",2011,"The maximum power temperature coefficients of a-DC modules are negative in indoor measurements, whereas the performance increases with module temperature in outdoor measurements.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['The University of Tokyo', 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology']",2,"['(The University of Tokyo, 0)', '(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

In order to effectively remove boron, less volatile than silicon, plasma injection gas was systematically varied. As a result, the most effective way to remove boron was additionally injecting hydrogen gas and steam with argon gas, which is a reactive gas of a general plasma injection routine.

On the other hand, we have developed special technologies for effectively using thinner substrates for HIT solar cells.

449,Diagnostics of thin-film silicon solar cells and solar panels/modules with variable intensity measurements (VIM),"A simple and low-cost method for analyzing amorphous silicon solar cells and modules, which have low values of the fill factor (FF), is proposed. Low fill factors can occur mainly because of 3 reasons: (a) excessive recombination due to “bad” intrinsic layers; (b) shunts and (c) very high series resistance. The method described here allows one to discriminate between (a), (b) and (c). It consists of measuring the J–V curves at different light intensities, varying typically from 0.05 to 1 sun. It has been called the “variable intensity method (VIM)”. Here, one plots Rsc=∂V/∂J (at V=0) and Roc=∂V/∂J (at J=0) as a function of Jsc. From the slope of the Rsc–Jsc curve, one derives the “collection voltage Vcoll”; from the asymptotic value of Rsc for low values of Jsc (<0.1mA/cm2) one obtains the “true” shunt resistance Rshunt; from the asymptotic value of Roc for high values of Jsc (around 10mA/cm2) one obtains the “true” series resistance Rseries. This paper shows quantitatively how too low values of Vcoll and of Rshunt as well as how too high a value of Rseries lead to a low value of FF for both cells and panels/modules.","O Ghahfarokhi, F Sculati-Meillaud, Z Bere ´nyi, R Kumar, A Shah","['Ecole Polytechnique Fe ´de ´rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Neuchâtel, Switzerland', 'Energosolar Budapest, Hungary', 'HHV Solar Technologies Private Limited, Bangalore, India']",2011,"A simple and low-cost method for analyzing amorphous silicon solar cells and modules, which have low values of the fill factor , is proposed.",['amorphous silicon'],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['HU', 'IN', 'CH']","['CHE', 'HUN', 'IND']","['Ecole Polytechnique Fe ´de ´rale de Lausanne (EPFL)', 'Energosolar Budapest', 'HHV Solar Technologies Private Limited']",2,"['(Ecole Polytechnique Fe ´de ´rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 0)', '(Energosolar Budapest, 1)', '(HHV Solar Technologies Private Limited, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy']"
450,Wide-gap a-Si1−xCx:H solar cells with high light-induced stability for multijunction structure applications,"Light-induced stability of various p–i–n type wide-gap a-Si1−xCx:H solar cells has been systematically investigated. The i-layers of all a-Si1−xCx:H solar cells were prepared using a 60MHz VHF-PECVD technique with monomethyl silane (SiH3CH3, MMS) as the carbon source. It was confirmed that device structures, especially the type of buffer layer and thickness of i-layer, strongly affect the degradation behavior of a-Si1−xCx:H solar cells. The fabricated a-Si1−xCx:H solar cells showed efficiency degradation of about 11–22% depending on device structure. Efficiency degradation of optimized a-Si1−xCx:H solar cells was much better compared with those reported by other groups even with thinner i-layer. These results revealed that a-Si1−xCx:H solar cells with optimized buffer layer and prepared using MMS as the carbon source have high light-induced stability. Moreover, we have also fabricated a-Si1−xCx:H/a-Si:H tandem cells with a SiOx intermediate layer to examine the benefit of a-Si1−xCx:H top cells. Up to now, Voc as high as 1.81V and fill factor (FF) as high as 0.70 have been achieved.

451,Substrate dependent stability and interplay between optical and electrical properties in μc-Si:H single junction solar cells,"In this work, we analyze the effect of rough ZnO front electrodes developed in-house favoring high current versus “smoother” substrates favoring good Voc and FF on the properties of microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) cells. Complete μc-Si:H p-i-n solar cells with intrinsic layer thicknesses varying from 1 to 6μm were deposited using very high frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The better scattering capabilities of rough substrates induce a significantly higher cell current in comparison to the smooth one for all the thicknesses. This allows a current output of more than 27mAcm−2 for cells thicker than 4μm. As a result, there is no full compensation of poor light scattering by thickness increase up to 6μm in μc-Si:H solar cells. Concerning the electrical characteristics, good quality cells are obtained for all thicknesses on smooth substrates, whereas the thick cells on rough substrates exhibit poorer electrical characteristics. Cells grown on smooth substrates show excellent stability under light soaking and atmospheric storage for all the thicknesses. However, a high increase of the saturation current is evidenced after atmospheric storage for cells grown on rough substrates and thus a degradation of their electrical characteristics is observed.","N Wyrsch, C Ballif, M Boccard, A Feltrin, M Despeisse, D Domine, P Cuony","['Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana (SUPSI), Canobbio, Switzerland', 'Fe ´de ´rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Ecole Polytechnique, Neuchâtel, Switzerland']",2011,"In this work, we analyze the effect of rough SiO front electrodes developed in-house favoring high current versus “smoother” substrates favoring good Poc andenthal on the properties of microcrystalline silicon cells.",[],[],[],[],"['junction solar', 'junction', 'single junction']",[],[],['CH'],['CHE'],"['Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana (SUPSI)', 'École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne']",0,"['(Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana (SUPSI), 0)', '(École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 0)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

The photovoltaic properties of the nano-grain electrodes were investigated by measuring the I–V behaviors, the IPCE spectra and the ac-impedance spectra. The nano-grain electrodes exhibited remarkably improved conversion efficiencies of 3.96% for the composite and 2.98% for the SnO2 electrode compared to the value of 1.66% for the usual nano-particle SnO2 electrode.

Efficient light trapping is achieved here by use of textured front and back contacts as well as by implementing an intermediate reflecting layer (IRL) between the individual cells of the tandem. This paper discusses the latest developments of IRLs at IMT Neuchâtel: SiOx based for micromorphs on glass and ZnO based IRLs for micromorphs on flexible substrates were successfully incorporated in micromorph tandem cells leading to high, matched, current above 13.8mA/cm2 for p–i–n tandems. In n–i–p configuration, asymmetric intermediate reflectors were employed to achieve currents of up to 12.5mA/cm2. On glass substrates, initial and stabilized efficiencies exceeding 13% and 11%, respectively, were thus obtained on 1cm2 cells, while on plastic foils with imprinted gratings, 11.2% initial and 9.8% stable efficiency could be reached. Recent progress on the development of effective front and back contacts will be described as well.","T Öderstr, C Ballif, M Boccard, A Feltrin, M Python, M Despeisse, D Domine, F Meillaud, P Cuony, S Nicolay, F-J Haug","['Fe ´de ´rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Ecole Polytechnique, Neuchâtel, Switzerland']",2011,"The conversion efficiency for microcrystalline/microcrystalline tandem solar cells requires both a dedicated light management, to keep the absorber layers as thin as possible, and optimized growth conditions of the microcrystalline silicon material.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['CH'],['CHE'],['École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne'],0,"['(École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 0)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

The higher short-circuit current density, the mediate open-circuit voltage and filled factor may arise from an equivalent resistance of the device system. A distinct shift of the spectral response and responsivity to ultraviolet and blue wavelength was found for the shallow junction SINP cell, which was also manifested by high quantum efficiency in the same wavelength.

The carrier recombination process has been discussed with emphasis on the photovoltaic properties of the solar cell. It has been found that: (i) PL intensity of the CIGS solar cells is much stronger than that in the corresponding CIGS thin films, (ii) the PL decay time of the cell is longer than that of the CIGS film, and (iii) the PL decay time of the CIGS solar cell exhibits strong dependence on the PL excitation intensity. In the CIGS solar cell, intense PL is obtained under the open circuit condition (oc), in contrast to the very low PL yield under the short circuit (sc) condition. The PL decay time under the sc condition is much shorter than that under the oc condition. Excitation intensity dependence of PL intensity and the PL decay time have been studied, and they are discussed with relation to the photo-voltage due to the PL excitation light. PL and injection EL under the external DC bias have been studied. The mapping image of NBE-PL intensity has been compared with that of the laser beam induced current (LBIC), and the PL intensity image reflects the photovoltaic properties of the CIGS solar cells.

461,Effect of loading on long term performance of single junction amorphous silicon modules,"The long-term behaviour of photovoltaic modules governs their economic feasibility. Amorphous silicon devices experience an initial degradation which is partially reversible due to thermal annealing. This degradation is commonly investigated using indoor light-soaking setups, typically leaving the devices open circuited. Alternatively, devices would be placed outdoors and in most cases are left open circuited as well. The outdoor exposure is closer to realistic performance as the devices will experience continuously changing environments as well as seasonal annealing and degradation cycles. However in both cases, the loading is not as it would be in realistic operation, where devices are operating at the maximum power point. The aim of this study is to verify if the practice of keeping modules at Voc is appropriate for outdoor measurements. The differences in the long term behaviour of the devices due to different loading strategies are investigated for open circuit, short circuit, fixed resistor loading, and MPPT. It is investigated for single junctions with more than 1 year outdoor exposure. It is shown that one needs to at least load the modules resistively to achieve realistic degradation rates, as the degradation at Voc overestimates by 23% and at Isc underestimates by 7.69% relative to the MPPT condition.","T Betts, R Gottschalg, K Astawa","['Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough Leicestershire, UK']",2011,"The long-term behaviour of photovoltaic modules governs their economic feasibility.

462,Generation characteristics of 100kW PV system with various tilt angle and direction arrays,"We report analysis about generation data of a 100kW PV system. The system consists of seven polycrystalline silicon arrays and three thin-film arrays. The rated power of each array is 10kW. Thin-film is made of tandem structure comprising amorphous silicon and microcrystalline silicon. For each array, tilt angles are arranged in 10°, 20° or 30°. And directions are facing due south, south–south east 30° and south–south west 30°. We have been analyzing generation data of the system since 2007 to understand the influence of system arrangement. The knowledge we have got until now is below.(a)Seasonal annealing occurs in thin-film arrays because thin-film cells contain amorphous silicon. Thus, theoretically, as for reduction of conversion efficiency in high temperature season, reduction of thin-film arrays is smaller than polycrystalline’s. We analyzed the ratio of seasonal generation energy (kWh) by using measured data of the system. Generation energy ratio in summer of thin-film is larger than polycrystalline’s. This is same trend as the theory.(b)There is a simulated data of solar irradiation that had been calculated by using meteorological data of 30 years. According to this simulated data, optimum condition of the system is arranged in tilt angle of 28.4° and facing due south. (The system is situated at latitude 33° north.)

463,Voltage-dependent quantum efficiency measurements of amorphous silicon multi-junction mini-modules,"Multi-junction solar cells have the potential to provide higher efficiencies than single junction devices and to reduce the impact of Staebler–Wronski degradation on amorphous silicon (a-Si) devices. They could, therefore, reduce the cost of solar electricity. However, their characterization presents additional challenges over that of single junction devices. Achieving acceptable accuracy of any current–voltage calibration requires correction of the current–voltage data with external quantum efficiency measurements and spectral mismatch calculations. This paper presents voltage-dependent EQE curves for both single junction and double junction a-Si solar cells, along with dispersion curves extracted from these data. In the case of single junction a-Si devices the mismatch factor is known to be voltage-dependent and a similar trend is shown to apply to multi-junction devices as well. However, the error introduced into current–voltage calibrations due to this bias dependence is found to be <1% for spectral mismatch calculations.","F Plyta, M Bliss, R Gottschalg, C Hibberd, T Betts, C Monokroussos","['Department for Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Loughborough University, Holywell Park GX Area Leicestershire, UK']",2011,A voltage-dependent mismatch factor for single junction and double junction amorphous silicon solar cells is presented.,['amorphous silicon'],[],[],[],"['junction', 'multi-junction', 'double junction', 'junction double', 'single junction']",[],[],['GB'],['GBR'],['Loughborough University'],0,"['(Loughborough University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

The crystalline volume fraction of doped a-Si:H layers using RF-PECVD was controlled from ∼0% (nearly full amorphous phase) to above 90% (nearly polycrystalline phase) through varying deposition conditions. The passivation property depended on the crystallinity more strongly for p-a-Si:H than n-a-Si:H of which crystallinity was more sensitive to deposition rate relatively. The implied Voc above 650mV was achieved with crystallinity less than about 5% for p-a-Si:H and 20% for n-a-Si:H. The HRTEM images confirmed the reliability of SE analysis with EMA modeling and showed the maximum part of crystalline phase exists at the interface of a-Si:H and c-Si in the form of epitaxial growth configuration.

468,Light trapping effect of patterned back surface reflectors in substrate-type single and tandem junction thin-film silicon solar cells,"Light trapping is a key issue to boost the efficiency of thin-film Si solar cells including μc-Si:H. In this paper, effect of textured back reflectors on light trapping in μc-Si:H cells has been investigated with self-orderly patterned Al substrates obtained by anodic oxidation. With increase in the period of the patterned substrates from 0 to 1.1μm, the short circuit current densities of 1-μm-thick μc-Si:H cells on the patterned substrates significantly increase from 18 to over 24mA/cm2, which is attributed to the improved light trapping in the infrared region. It has been clarified that this enhanced light-trapping effect in longer wavelengths is mainly attributed to the improved light scattering at the rear side by comparing μc-Si:H solar cells with polished and as-deposited front surfaces. The effectiveness of the patterned Al substrates has also been demonstrated in an a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem cell with a bottom cell thickness of 1μm, showing a higher conversion efficiency than the reference cell.","Michio Kondo, Hitoshi Sai","['Research Center for Photovoltaics, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan']",2011,The effect of textured back reflectors on light trapping in c-Si:N cells has been investigated with self-orderly patterned Si substrates obtained by anodic oxidation.,[],[],[],[],['junction'],[],['light trapping'],['JP'],['JPN'],['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology'],1,"['(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Performance of Solar Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

Sulfurizations of metallic Cu–Zn–Sn films were done for stacked metallic films, Cu/Sn/Zn/glass, Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn/glass and Sn/Cu/Zn/glass, which were prepared by sputtering method in high vacuum chamber. The sprayed films were not observed to be grown well with good crystallinity, compared with CZTS films made by sulfurization of stacked metallic films. However, it was found that application of additional sulfurization to sprayed CZTS films induced great improvement of crystallinity to the level of the sulfurized metallic films.

471,Effects of ITO precursor thickness on transparent conductive Al doped ZnO film for solar cell applications,"Al doped ZnO (AZO) film was continuously deposited on ITO precursor on glass substrate by d.c. magnetron sputtering. The thickness of ITO was varied from 30 to 120nm in order to investigate the effect of ITO thickness on crystallinity of AZO film. X-ray diffraction measurement shows that AZO film grown on ITO has an enhanced (00 2) preferred orientation as the ITO thickness was increased. The crystalline structure improvement of AZO film with an increase of ITO precursor thickness is due to the near-epitaxial growth of AZO on ITO precursor. As the ITO thickness was increased, mobility of AZO film by the Hall measurement was significantly increased from 5.4cm2/Vs (no ITO) to 23.6cm2/Vs (ITO 120nm), and resistivity was about 81.7% improved from 1.99×10−3 to 3.63×10−4Ωcm. The AZO films with ITO revealed excellent average transmission of visible (90.0%) and NIR (89.6%) regions, whereas those of AZO film without ITO were 82.1% and 88.1%, respectively. The haze values of AZO film with ITO of 90 and 120 nm are similar or higher than those of AZO film without ITO.

The GMWNTs sheets were lifted off from the Si substrate by buffered oxide etching and were transplanted on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass by Van der Waals force as a counter electrode.

The redesign of PV/T system was further studied by changing the system configuration from a 4×4 configuration to simulate various configurations consisting of 8×2, 3×4, 4×3 and 6×2. For the same number of PV/T module (16), the 4×4 configuration provided better flow distribution, when compared with an 8×2 configuration. When decreasing to 12 modules, it was shown that the 3×4 configuration resulted in the most suitable flow distribution, compared with the 4×3 and 6×2 configurations.

475,Screen printed phosphorus diffusion for low-cost and simplified industrial mono-crystalline silicon solar cells,"Screen-printing is considered to be the most efficient technique for large-scale Si solar cell production. Doping technique currently in use, such as POCl3 diffusion furnace, H3PO4 spray doping and spin-on-doping (SOD) tend to be time-consuming and wasteful of source materials. Screen printing technology can be used for the application of doping substance for diffusion. Diffusion paste doping by the support of screen printing has enough potential to overcome the disadvantages of other doping techniques. This paper demonstrates a simple method for creation of P–N junction, with efficiency above 16.1%, using a screen printable phosphorus diffusion paste. To optimize the doping process using screen printing, we varied several experimental conditions, including firing temperatures and time. A fill factor above 77% has been reached, with an efficiency of 16.1% in a 10.0cm×10.0cm. The high fill factor with paste doping is mainly due to a contact resistance (3.53Ω) lower than that for POCl3 (5.64Ω).

The CN stretching bands of R505 at 2000–2100cm−1 appeared to change drastically at ≈140°C on TiO2 surfaces, whereas a major CN peak at ∼2090cm−1 disappeared at a much higher temperature above ≈250°C in their solid states.

477,Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells by transplanting highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays,"Highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays fabricated by anodization are very attractive to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) due to their superior charge percolation and slower charge recombination. However, the efficiency of TiO2-nanotube-based DSCs is 6.89%, which is still lower than that of TiO2-nanoparticle-based DSCs.

482,Fabrication of microcrystalline silicon solar cells on a SnO2 coated substrate using seed layer insertion,"We fabricated hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) solar cells on SnO2 coated glass using a seed layer insertion technique. Since rich hydrogen atoms from the μc-Si:H deposition process degrade the SnO2 layer, we applied p-type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (p-a-Si:H) as a window layer. To grow the μc-Si:H layer on the p-a-Si:H window layer, we developed a seed layer insertion method. We inserted the seed layer between the p-a-Si:H layer and intrinsic bulk μc-Si:H. This seed layer consists of a thin hydrogen diluted silicon buffer layer and a naturally hydrogen profiled layer. We compared the characteristics of solar cells with and without the seed layer. When the seed layer was not applied, the fabricated cell showed the characteristics of a-Si:H solar cell whose spectral response was in a range of 400–800nm. Using the seed layer, we achieved a μc-Si:H solar cell with performance of Voc=0.535V, Jsc=16.0mA/cm2, FF=0.667, and conversion efficiency=5.7% without any back reflector.

The effects of various over-layers and O2 plasma treatment on TiO2 electrodes have been investigated. Over-layers were coated by dip coating in a solution of saturated Ba(NO3)2, Mg(NO3)2 and N2O6Sr, which reduced the recombination of electrons from the photo excited state of Ru dye. O2 plasma treatment was applied to improve both the contact ability with the dye and the electron takeover capability by reducing oxygen vacancies on both the TiO2 and the over-layer surface. The photo conversion efficiency of DSSC was improved by both over-layer coating and O2 plasma treatment. In particular, dipping in saturated Ba(NO3)2 solution and O2 plasma treatment (BP), the photo conversion efficiency was greatly improved from 5.27% to 6.76%. The reason was that the over-layers and O2 plasma treatment decreased electron recombination. The energy barrier of the modified over-layers blocks the electron transfer from TiO2 to the electrolyte, and consequently increases electron density by extending the electron lifetime. O2 plasma treatment also increased the Ru dye absorption.","Jun Kim, Sang Kim","['Department of Materials Engineering, Korea University of Technology and Education, Byungcheon-myun Cheonan-city Chungnam, South Korea']",2011,The anti-recombination property and the surface area of TiO2 influence the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells .

In the initial stage of deposition where the silicon film deposited without HCl addition consisted almost entirely of the amorphous incubation layer; highly crystalline silicon films could be deposited with HCl addition. As the flow rate of HCl increased, the crystallinity of silicon films increased but the film growth rate decreased.

While alkaline texturing of single-crystalline Si (sc-Si) wafers was well established, no chemical solution has been successfully developed for multi-crystalline Si (mc-Si) wafers. Reactive-ion-etch (RIE) is a promising technique for effective texturing of both sc-Si and mc-Si wafers, regardless of crystallographic characteristics, and more suitable for thin wafers. However, due to the use of plasma source generated by high power, the wafer surface gets a physical damage during the processing, which requires an additional subsequent damage-removal wet processing. In this work, we developed a damage-free RIE texturing for mc-Si solar cells. An improved self-masking RIE texturing process, developed in this study, produced ∼0.7% absolute efficiency gain on 156×156mm2 mc-Si cells, where the gas ratio and the plasma power density were keys to mitigate the plasma-induced-damage during the RIE processing while maintaining decent surface reflectance. In the self-masking RIE texturing, a mixture of SF6/Cl2/O2 gases was found to significantly affect the surface morphology uniformity and reflectance, where an optimal etch depth was found to be 200–400nm.

487,Influences of water in bis-benzimidazole-derivative electrolyte additives to the degradation of the dye-sensitized solar cells,"The chemical stability of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) determines both the cell performance and the cell life-time. The presence of water in the solar cell from surrounding leakage through the imperfection packaging sealants causes the decrease in life-time of photogenerated electrons on the working electrodes, which induces the occurrence of the dark current to the electrolytes and thus leakage current significantly deteriorated the life-time of the DSSC. Reliable electrolyte additives diminishing the influences of water to the DSSCs degradation process becomes a critical issue in maintaining an acceptable cell life-time. In this work, the effects of four benzimidazole derivatives a–d as the electrolyte additives in the presence of water were comprehensively examined by time-dependent photovoltaic performance of the cells. As a result, open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), efficiency (η), and fill factor (FF) collected from I–V curves were studied. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was implemented to evaluate the effects of the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the interfaces between TiO2/dye/electrolyte. Results showed that the bis-benzimidazole derivative c gives significant improvement in the long-term stability due to the effective protection of the ligands between dye and working electrodes from the attack by environmental water molecules.","Sheng-Tung Huang, Hung-Lin Lu, Nanocrystalline Tio, Yu-Hui Lee, C.-K Yang, Chaochin Su","['Institute of Organic and Polymeric Materials, National Taipei University of Technology, Taiwan, ROC', 'Institute of Biotechnology, National Taipei University of Technology, Taiwan, ROC', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taiwan, ROC']",2011,The chemical stability of dye-sensitized solar cells determines both the cell performance and the cell life-time.

The electrical performances of the solar strings were characterized before and after the soldering process by a solar flasher, and strings with commercial ribbons of lead and lead-free are compared. In general, lead ribbon solar strings show lower power loss value than lead-free counterparts. And the commercial lead and lead-free ribbon strings show highest power loss around 6.66%–10.65% of all the solar strings. Furthermore, the power losses for patterned lead (pat-SAP) and lead-free (pat-SAC) solar string are 3.93% and 5.51%, respectively, implying that a patterned structure should improve the soldering process and result in lower power loss. Yet, significant low output power loss values are detected in the solar strings which are soldered with high-conductivity ribbons. It is estimated that the power loss for high-conductivity lead (con-SAP) and lead-free (con-SAC) solar strings are 3.89% and 4.43%, respectively. And a similar condition was revealed when the solder materials were practically interconnected the solar cells in PV modules.

495,Induction melting process using segmented graphite crucible for silicon melting,"Induction melting process using segmented graphite crucible was investigated to melt silicon feedstock for solar cells. Induction melting is the key technology used in silicon melting process, such as ingot-growing, metallurgical refining and ribbon production. However, contamination of silicon from the crucible in induction melting is the main source of degrading the silicon. In this paper, new structure of crucible was suggested to minimize the contamination from the crucible wall. It was the segmentation of graphite crucible wall that introduced the non-contact between melt and inner wall of crucible. Numerical and experimental studies of induction melting process of silicon using the suggested crucible were conducted. For numerical analysis, 3D models of crucible, induction coil and silicon were constructed and electromagnetic force and temperature distribution in silicon and crucible were calculated. To evaluate a process with the suggested crucible, induction melting system was built up based on the simulated results and experiments of silicon melting were carried out.","Joon Kim, Young Ahn, Bo Jang","['Korea Institute of Energy Research, Daejeon, Republic of Korea']",2011,The induction melting process of silicon using segmented graphite crucible was investigated to melt silicon feedstock for solar cells.,[],[],[],"['graphite crucible', 'segmented graphite', 'graphite']",[],"['graphite crucible', 'segmented graphite', 'graphite']",[],['KR'],['KOR'],['Korea Institute of Energy Research'],1,"['(Korea Institute of Energy Research, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
496,Outdoor testing of PV module temperature and performance under different mounting and operational conditions,"Outdoor performance of photovoltaic (PV) modules primarily depends on the instantaneous plane-of-array irradiance (Gpoa) and PV module temperature (Tpv). Tpv can be estimated from the ambient temperature (Tamb) and the Gpoa as Tpv=Tamb+kTGpoa. The coefficient kT depends strongly on the way the PV module is mounted (open rack, ventilated or unventilated roof mounting, etc.), wind speed and also on the module type. In the presented paper, open rack mounted and unventilated roof integrated cases of PV module installation are experimentally and theoretically examined. Linear relationship with kT is upgraded with a nonlinear one based on the energy balance model and measured data. Nevertheless, Tpv is also affected by the module’s regime of operation. The Tpv dependency on different regime of operation (open-circuit and maximum power point tracking) for two types of PV modules in two regimes is reported. Differences are discussed in light of energy balance equation within thermal management, where impact of the PV module conversion efficiency on Tpv is also shown.","Marko Topic, Jurij Kurnik, Kristijan Brecl, Marko Jankovec","['Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia']",2011,"In the presented paper, open rack mounted and unventilated roof integrated cases of MEMS module installation are experimentally and theoretically examined.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['SI'],['SVN'],['University of Ljubljana'],0,"['(University of Ljubljana, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
497,Ga homogenization by simultaneous H2Se/H2S reaction of Cu-Ga–In precursor,"The compositional distribution of Ga and S in Cu(InGa)(SeS)2 films fabricated by a simultaneous selenization and sulfization process was systematically investigated. At low H2Se/H2S reaction temperature (490°C), most Ga remains at the back of the film adjacent to the Mo back contact. However, the Ga/III ratios at the top and bottom of the Cu(InGa)(SeS)2 layer monotonically increase and decrease with reaction temperatures, respectively. At T>550°C, homogeneous distribution of elemental Ga and In through film is achieved. Further increase of the reaction temperature (e.g., T>550°C) causes phase segregation on the surface of the Cu(InGa)(SeS)2 film confirmed by XRD, GIXRD and EDS analysis.","Gregory Hanket, Woo Kim, William Shafarman","['Institute of Energy Conversion, University of Delaware, Newark, USA', 'School of Display and Chemical Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Korea']",2011,The compositional distribution of Si and S in Si2 films fabricated by a simultaneous selenization and sulfization process was systematically investigated.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['KR', 'US']","['KOR', 'USA']","['University of Delaware', 'Yeungnam University']",0,"['(University of Delaware, 0)', '(Yeungnam University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

499,Scale-up issues of CIGS thin film PV modules,"Photovoltaics cost has been declining following a 70% learning curve. Now the challenge is to bring down the cost of solar electricity to make it competitive with conventional sources within the next decade. In the long run, the module efficiencies tend to reach 80% of the champion cell efficiencies. Using a semiempirical methodology, it has been shown earlier that while the triple junction a-Si:H thin film technology is competitive, CIGS and CdTe thin film module technologies are highly competitive and presently offer the best approach for significantly exceeding the cost/performance levels of standard and non-standard crystalline Si PV technologies. Since 2006, the production of thin film solar cell in the U.S. has surpassed that of c-Si. At present, the production of CIGS PV modules lags considerably behind that of CdTe PV modules. This is mainly because of its complexity. Scale-up issues related to various CIGS preparation technologies such as co-evaporation, metallic precursor deposition by magnetron sputtering and non-vacuum techniques such as ink-jet printing, electroplating or doctor-blade technology followed by their selenization/sulfurization are discussed so as to assist the CIGS technology to attain its full potential. Besides the welcome announcements of large volume production, it is essential to achieve the production cost below $1/Wp in the near term and attain production speeds comparable to CdTe production speeds. Comparable production speeds are expected to be achieved within the next decade. This will enable reduction of CIGS module production costs to ∼65¢/Wp that would be comparable to the CdTe module projected production cost.

502,Development of thin film amorphous silicon oxide/microcrystalline silicon double-junction solar cells and their temperature dependence,"We have developed thin film silicon double-junction solar cells by using micromorph structure. Wide bandgap hydrogenated amorphous silicon oxide (a-SiO:H) film was used as an absorber layer of top cell in order to obtain solar cells with high open circuit voltage (Voc), which are attractive for the use in high temperature environment. All p, i and n layers were deposited on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coated glass substrate by a 60MHz-very-high-frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (VHF–PECVD) technique. The p–i–n–p–i–n double-junction solar cells were fabricated by varying the CO2 and H2 flow rate of i top layer in order to obtain the wide bandgap with good quality material, which deposited near the phase boundary between a-SiO:H and hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon oxide (μc-SiO:H), where the high Voc can be expected. The typical a-SiO:H/μc-Si:H solar cell showed the highest initial cell efficiency of 10.5%. The temperature coefficient (TC) of solar cells indicated that the values of TC for conversion efficiency (η) of the double-junction solar cells were inversely proportional to the initial Voc, which corresponds to the bandgap of the top cells. The TC for η of typical a-SiO:H/μc-Si:H was −0.32%/°C, lower than the value of conventional a-Si:H/μc-Si:H solar cell. Both the a-SiO:H/μc-Si:H solar cell and the conventional solar cell showed the same light induced degradation ratio of about 20%.

Although the trap is shallow, its capture cross section is relatively large to capture electrons and holes. The decrease in the number of traps is explained by the electron–hole recombination process.

With decrease in dc power and gas pressure and increase in target-to-substrate distance, the IZO films with high transmittance and low resistivity were obtained. The observation of the IZO films by atomic force microscopy indicated that the microstructure and surface morphology of the films were responsible for the transmittance.

The morphology of films grown by this process changes in a rapid manner as soon as their composition becomes copper rich beyond stoichiometry. For investigation of the structural changes, synchrotron radiation energy-dispersive X-ray diffractometry was used. Cu-rich and Cu-poor absorbers with an in-depth gallium gradient were grown by physical vapor deposition. These were transferred to a thermal processing reaction chamber which allows in-situ characterization. In the Cu-rich case changes in energy and shape of the measured diffraction signals caused by heating the samples could be attributed to the leveling of indium and gallium gradients within the layer. As a secondary method glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy was used to confirm this result. Cu-poor reference samples did not show a similarly significant intermixing of indium and gallium during annealing.

The model is used to explain the differences in dark and illuminated measurements, which clearly shows the illuminated LBIC signal is largely dependent on the homogeneity of the background illumination. The dark LBIC is largely affected by the shunt resistance of the neighbouring cells rather than by the signal strength of the cell under test.

513,Enhanced performance of solar cells with anti-reflection layer fabricated by nano-imprint lithography,"Because of increase in demand for clean energy sources, photovoltaic device is becoming more important as a new power plant. To replace fossil fuels with photovoltaics, generating electricity with solar cells should meet cost effectiveness and high efficiency. An anti-reflection technique is one of the effective methods to achieve high efficiency. To reduce the reflection at the surface of concentrated photovoltaic device, a nanometer scale dot-pattern array was formed on the surface of GaInP/Ga(In)As/Ge solar cells by nano-imprint lithography. Since this nano-pattern is smaller than the wavelength of visible light, the effective refractive index near the surface changes gradually. Thus, the reflection of the light at the surface with moth-eye structure can be effectively reduced for overall spectral region. As a result, a solar cell with the moth-eye pattern as an anti-reflection layer showed lower reflectance and enhanced total conversion efficiency, compared to a solar cell without a moth-eye patterned layer.

The trap density of ζ increased from 5×1014 to 4×1015cm−3 with decrease in Se beam pressure; the trap densities of α and β did not change. These results suggest that the origin of ζ is related to the Se deficiency. The density of ζ seems to correlate with the cell efficiency.

515,Effect of retrograde solubility on the purification of MG Si during fractional melting,"MG Si can be effectively refined using a fractional melting process. The efficiency of fractional melting depends on two parameters, the heating rate and the wetness. Generally, the heating rate should be slow to ensure impurity diffusion and, in order to perfectly separate the liquid from the solid/liquid mixture, there should not be higher wetness. Many MG Si metal impurities exhibit retrograde solubility. The metal impurity behaviors with retrograde solubility were studied during the FM process. The change of the microstructure during the process was also studied with a SEM and an EPMA. Due to the retrograde behavior, slow heating below the maximum solubility temperature was not necessary to refine MG Si. For the FM process, the operating temperature range to refine MG Si should be carefully selected considering the behavior of major metal impurities in the mushy zone.","Boyun Jang, Joonsoo Kim, Youngsoo Ahn, Wooyoung Yoon, Juho Chung, Heon Lee","['Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'Energy Conversion and Storage Research Center, Korea Institute of Energy Research, Daejeon, Republic of Korea']",2011,"The present invention relates to a fractional melting process for the refining of lead zirconium, wherein the operating temperature range to refine lead zirconium is carefully selected considering the behavior of major metal impurities in the mushy zone.",[],[],[],"['zirconium', 'lead']",[],[],[],['KR'],['KOR'],"['Korea University', 'Korea Institute of Energy Research']",2,"['(Korea University, 0)', '(Korea Institute of Energy Research, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

We investigated the material properties of μc-Si films deposited by using 13.56MHz plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) from a conventional H2 dilution in SiH4. Two types of intrinsic μc-Si films deposited at the high pressure narrow electrode gap and the low pressure wide electrode gap were studied for the solar cell absorption layers. The material properties were characterized using dark conductivity, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements. The μc-Si quality and solar cell performance were mainly determined by microstructure characteristics. Solar cells adopting the optimized μc-Si film demonstrated high stability with no significant changes in solar cell performance after air exposure for six months and subsequent illumination for over 300h. The results can be explained that low ion bombardment and high atomic hydrogen density under the PECVD condition of the high pressure narrow electrode gap produce high-quality μc-Si films for solar cell application.","Czang-Ho Lee, Myunghun Shin, Mi-Hwa Lim, Donguk Choi, Jung-Eun Lee, Byoung-June Kim, Hee-Yong Lee, Jun-Yong Seo","['Samsung Electronics, Yongin City Gyeonggi-do, South Korea']",2011,The paper reviews the material requirements of microcrystalline silicon in terms of the device operation and configuration for thin film solar cells and thin film transistors .,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['KR'],['KOR'],['Samsung Electronics'],1,"['(Samsung Electronics, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

Deposition parameters and wet etching conditions of the films were controlled precisely to obtain the optimized surface features. All as-deposited films show a strong preferred orientation in the [001] direction under our experimental conditions. The microstructure of the films was significantly affected by working pressure and film compactness was reduced with increasing working pressure, while the effect of a substrate temperature on the microstructure is less pronounced. A low resistivity of 4.25×10−4Ωcm and high optical transmittance of above 80% in a visible range were obtained in the films deposited at 1.5mTorr and 100°C. After wet etching process, the surface morphologies of the films were changed dramatically depending on the microstructure and film compactness of the initial films. By controlling the surface feature, the haze factor and angular resolved distribution of the textured ZnO:Al films were improved remarkably when compared with commercial SnO2:F films. The textured ZnO:Al and SnO2:F films were applied as substrates for a silicon thin film solar cells with tandem structure of a-Si:H/μc-Si:H. Compared with the solar cells with the SnO2:F films, a significant enhancement in the short-circuit current density of the μc-Si:H bottom cell was achieved, which is due to the improved light scattering on the highly textured ZnO:Al film surfaces in the long wavelength above 600nm.","Young-Jin Kim, Kyung Yoon, Sang-Hyun Park, Chul Lee, Jun-Sik Cho","['Photovoltaic Research Center, Korea Institute of Energy Research, Daejeon, Republic of Korea']",2011,A method for improving the light scattering properties of silicon thin film solar cells by controlling the surface morphologies of the films.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['KR'],['KOR'],['Korea Institute of Energy Research'],1,"['(Korea Institute of Energy Research, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

The external quantum efficiency of multi-stacked InGaAs QD solar cells extends the photo-absorption spectra toward a wavelength longer than the GaAs band gap, and the quantum efficiency increases as the number of stacking layers increases.

A leakage of the liquid electrolyte to cells generally occurs in the DSSCs because of a chemical reaction between the sealing material and the electrolyte. This leakage is correlated to the long-term stability and energy conversion efficiency of the dye-sensitized solar module. This study examined the reactions between the electrolyte and the glass using a leaching test with the aim of using this material as the matrix of the sealing materials in DSSCs. The prepared samples were evaluated using an inductively coupled plasma spectroscope, a nanoindentation test, an atomic force microscope and a contact angle analyzer. After the leaching test, the zinc and boron ions from the glass were leached into the electrolyte after immersion for 1h. The elastic modulus, hardness, and surface roughness of the glass changed after the formation of the leached layer of the glass surface. The results suggested that the compositions of the oxide sealant should be considered in terms of the chemical stability in the electrolyte.","Seongjin Hwang, Ilbok Lee, Hyungsun Kim","['School of Materials Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, Republic of Korea']",2011,The present invention relates to the use of an oxide sealant in the liquid electrolyte of dye-sensitized solar cells.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['KR'],['KOR'],['Inha University'],0,"['(Inha University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

523,Large-area multicrystalline silicon solar cell fabrication using reactive ion etching (RIE),"Surface texturing of crystalline silicon wafer improves the conversion efficiency of solar cells by the enhancement in antireflection property and light trapping. Compared to antireflection coating, it is a more permanent and effective scheme. Wet texturing with the chemicals such as alkali (NaOH, KOH) or acid (HF, HNO3, CH3COOH) is too difficult for thinner wafer to apply due to a large amount of silicon loss. However, Plasma surface texturing using Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) can be effective in reducing the surface reflectance with low silicon loss. In this study, we have fabricated a large-area (156×156mm) multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cell by mask less surface texturing using a SF6/O2 reactive ion etching.

526,Analysis of series resistance of crystalline silicon solar cell with two-layer front metallization based on light-induced plating,"Improving the front metallization quality of silicon solar cells should be a key to enhance cell performance. In this work, we investigated a two-layer metallization scheme involving light-induced plating (LIP) and tried to quantify its impact on the series resistance of the front grid metals and FFs on finished cells. To estimate the effect of LIP processing on a printed and fired seed layer, individual components of series resistance were measured before and after LIP processing. Among them, grid resistance and contact resistance were closely observed because of their large contribution to series resistance. To optimize the plating on the seed metal grid, the grid resistance of the two-layer metal grid structure was calculated as a function of cross section area of the plated layer. Contact resistivity of the grid before and after LIP processing was analyzed to understand the contact resistance reduction, as well. As a result, the efficiency of solar cells with 80μm seed metal grid width increased by 0.3% absolute compared with conventional solar cells of 120μm metal grid width. The total area of electrodes in conventional cells was 1800mm2 and electrodes area of LIP processed solar cells was 1400mm2.

B2H6 was also employed as a dopant gas. It was found that the crystal orientation of ZnO films strongly depends on D2O/H2O ratio. As a result, the surface morphology of ZnO changed from textured surface morphology to smooth surface morphology with increase in the ratio of D2O/H2O. Moreover, it was also observed that the carrier concentration of ZnO films did not change with the ratio of D2O/H2O, while the mobility of these films was strongly dependent on the D2O/H2O ratio. Without D2O addition, the resistivity of films had its lowest value and the minimum sheet resistance was 10Ω/square. All films showed transmittance higher than 80% in the visible region. Moreover, the haze values of these films could be controlled by the ratio of D2O/H2O. These results indicate that the crystal orientation and surface morphology of the low resistivity ZnO films can be modified by using a mixture of D2O and H2O without changing the deposition temperature.

The silicon wafer was treated using a wet process, and the SiNx:H film was deposited on the back surface. Hydrogen plasma was applied to the front surface of the wafer, and the SiNx:H film was deposited on the hydrogen plasma treated surface using an in-situ process. The SiNx:H film deposition was carried out at a low temperature (<350°C) in a direct plasma reactor operated at 13.6MHz. The surface recombination velocity measurement after the hydrogen plasma pre-treatment and the comparison with the ammonia plasma pre-treatment were made using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements. The passivation qualities were measured using quasi-steady-state photoconductance.

The etching duration was varied to achieve PS layers of different morphologies and thicknesses. Both the photoluminescence (PL) and the total diffused reflectivity spectra of the PS layers were measured. It was found that for the PS layers grown for etching durations of less than 90s the PL emission is insignificant and reflectivity is quite low. Such PS layers can be used as antireflection coatings (ARC) on solar cells. The PS layers formed for etching durations greater than 90s show a significant PL emission in 500–800nm range with peak lying in 630–660nm wavelength range. When etching duration increases from 90s to 8min the PL intensity increases and the PL peak shows a blue shift. With further increase in etching duration the PL intensity decreases and PL peak shows a red shift. The reflectivity of the photoluminescent layers increases with etching duration showing a highest value for a sample grown for 8min. Further increase in etching duration up to 20min the reflectivity decreases and then increases.

Depending on the actual RTP temperature profile, the films might exhibit CuInS2/CuGaS2 (top/bottom) segregation, which is rather detrimental for a large VOC. We found that only precursors sulfurized at sufficiently high temperatures exhibit the desired interdiffusion of the segregated CuInS2/CuGaS2 layers resulting in an increased VOC. Moreover, temperature dependent current–voltage profiling (suns-VOC-analysis) yielded strong indications for improved current collection and reduced losses for devices with proper interdiffusion of the CuInS2/CuGaS2 layers. A more fundamental question is related to the variation and formation of defect states in differently processed absorber films. The studied samples were thus further investigated by means of admittance spectroscopy, which allowed us to confirm the presence of three individual defect states in both absorber configurations. Two defects exhibit activation energies, which remain unchanged upon varying the RTP temperature whereas a third state exhibits significantly increased activation energy in devices showing interdiffusion of CuInS2/CuGaS2 layers. According to the characteristic shift of the conduction band edge upon Ga-doping we conclude that the latter defect level corresponds with the minority carriers in the p-type absorbers.","J Parisi, J Ohland, I Riedel, J Keller, J Riediger, R Mainz, S Merdes, M Knipper","['Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie Berlin GmbH, Berlin, Germany', 'Department of Physics, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany']",2011,The present invention relates to a method for improving the efficiency of solar cells by controlling the variation and formation of defect states in differently processed absorber films.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['DE'],['DEU'],"['Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie Berlin GmbH', 'University of Oldenburg']",2,"['(Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie Berlin GmbH, 1)', '(University of Oldenburg, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy']"
534,Method for fabricating the compact layer in dye-sensitized solar cells by titanium sputter deposition and acid-treatments,"Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been put forward as a potential low-cost alternative to the widely used silicon solar cells, which are subject to cost limitations. However, some problems need to be solved in order to enhance the efficiency of DSCs. In particular, the electron recombination occurred by the contact between the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and a redox electrolyte is one of the main limiting factors of efficiency. Accordingly, a compact layer plays an important role in realizing highly efficient DSCs because it improves the adhesion of the TiO2 to the TCO and provides a larger contact area and more effective electron transfer by preventing electron recombination. In this work, the fabrication of a TiO2 compact layer using Ti sputter deposition and acid-treatment was investigated rather than the conventional method, which uses a TiCl4 aqueous solution. The acid-treatment of the sputtered Ti film actively oxidized the Ti particles. As a result, such a cell exhibited an additional 1.3% in total efficiency compared to the standard DSC without a compact layer. These improvements are not inferior to those obtained by the conventional fabrication method using a TiCl4 aqueous solution.","Jin-Kyoung Kim, Min-Kyu Son, Hee-Je Kim, Inyoung Shin, Kandasamy Prabakar, Hyunwoong Seo","['Department of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, Geumjeong, Republic of Korea']",2011,"The fabrication of a GaN2 compact layer using Si sputter deposition and acid-treatment was investigated rather than the conventional method, which uses a SiAl4 aqueous solution.",[],[],[],['titanium'],[],[],[],['KR'],['KOR'],['Pusan National University'],0,"['(Pusan National University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

536,Structural and electrical properties of polycrystalline silicon films deposited by hot-wire CVD,"The polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) films are deposited on low-temperature glass substrate by hot-wire CVD. The SiH4 gas flow rate {F(SiH4)} is a critical parameter both for deposition rate and for crystalline properties. The poly-Si films deposited at low F(SiH4) with moderate deposition rate (about 3μm/h) have superior crystalline properties and crystalline volume fraction that exceeds 90%. The films also have natural texture structure on the surface that is strongly recommended in thin-film solar cells in order to obtain high current density by increasing incident light trapping. By increasing F(SiH4) to 10sccm, the high deposition rate (20μm/h) is obtained, but crystalline properties deteriorated in these samples. However, these films have high potentials for thick (20–30μm) solar cell applications due to the high deposition rate and enhanced grain growth; average grain sizes are larger than that of low-F(SiH4) samples although small nano-sized grains still exist, by which crystalline volume fraction was <70%. The secondary ion mass spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed that the films have considerable amount of O and C within the films and this is originated from impurity penetration during storing the samples in atmosphere.","Jeong Lee, Kyung Yoon, Jun Park, Ki Kang, Jinsoo Song, Ki Kim","['Korea Institute of Energy Research, Taejon, South Korea']",2002,The polycrystalline silicon films deposited at low F with moderate deposition rate have superior crystalline properties and crystalline volume fraction that exceeds 10%.,['polycrystalline silicon'],[],[],[],[],[],[],['KR'],['KOR'],['Korea Institute of Energy Research'],1,"['(Korea Institute of Energy Research, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

A current density of 9.44mA/cm2 has been generated in an i-layer of only 150nm thick without any back-reflector. A deposition rate of 0.75Å/s for such a thin layer gives this material much advantage than a μc-Si cell, where a thickness of >2μm is needed.

Optical and thermal activations of doped iron are investigated to study the difference between the two techniques in obtaining iron concentration. Minority carrier lifetimes increase or decrease after activation due to the different optical injection levels of both the SPV and μ-PCD techniques. No noticeable effect of chemical passivation in obtained iron concentration is observed.

In this study, we fabricate SiO2/Si/SiO2 QW layers by RF magnetron sputtering and thermal oxidation. On high-resistivity (300Ωcm) n-type silicon wafer substrates, the effective surface recombination velocity provided by our SiO2/Si/SiO2 QWs is around 4cm/s for 13Å Si thickness and 480cm/s for 150Å Si thickness. The parasitic optical absorption in the well-passivating QWs is negligible for terrestrial photovoltaic applications.

We have reported that the suppression of darkening and wide optical gap (Eopt) are obtained by using SiH2Cl2 instead of SiH4 as a source gas (Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. 609 (2000), in press). In this paper, p-type a-Si:H:(Cl) was investigated. Comparable Eopt and dark conductivity (σdark) to those of conventional a-SiC:H were obtained. Solar cells using this a-Si:H:(Cl) show higher current density (Jsc) and higher collection efficiency in all wavelength regions as compared to a p-layer not using chlorine processes. The newly developed p-layer has been applied to solar cells with p–i–n structure fabricated at higher substrate temperatures (Ts). Although the a-Si:H material deposited at higher substrate temperatures has been reported as being more stable against light soaking (21st IEEE PVSC Proceeding, Florida, USA, 1990, p. 1656), the high temperature processing is difficult to apply to the a-Si:H p–i–n structure because of the significant darkening of SnO2 at higher Ts.

The Si crystallization of Al/a-Si during AIC was much faster than that of Al/Al oxide/a-Si. The annealing of glass/Al/a-Si led to poly-Si films with small Si grains compared to that of glass/Al/Al oxide/a-Si. It is difficult to observe the influence of the crystallization temperatures (400–500°C) on the crystallization of glass/Al/a-Si. With annealing of glass/Al/a-Si at 300°C, the crystallization of a-Si occurred not only in the original Al layer but also in the original a-Si layer. With lowering crystallization temperature of glass/Al/Al oxide/a-Si, it is observed that poly-Si films become oriented preferentially in the (100) direction normal to the surface and had larger grains.

568,Fundamental understanding and implementation of Al-enhanced PECVD SiNx hydrogenation in silicon ribbons,"A low-cost, manufacturable defect gettering and passivation treatment, involving simultaneous anneal of a PECVD SiNx film and a screen-printed Al layer, is found to improve the lifetime in Si ribbon materials from 1–10μs to over 20μs. Our results indicate that the optimum anneal temperature for SiNx-induced hydrogenation is 700°C for EFG and increases to 825°C when Al is present on the back of the sample. This not only improves the degree of hydrogenation, but also forms an effective back surface field. We propose a three-step physical model, based on our results, in which defect passivation is governed by the release of hydrogen from the SiNx film due to annealing, the generation of vacancies during Al–Si alloying, and the retention of hydrogen at defect sites due to rapid cooling. Controlled rapid cooling was implemented after the hydrogenation anneal to improve the retention of hydrogen at defect sites by incorporating an RTP contact firing scheme. RTP contact firing improved the performance of ribbon solar cells by 1.3–1.5% absolute when compared to slow, belt furnace contact firing. This enhancement was due to improved back surface recombination velocity, fill factor, and bulk lifetime.

Both increase of cell efficiency as well as lowering costs is demanded. Back-contacted solar cells offer multiple advantages in terms of reducing module assembling costs and enhanced cell efficiency. The investigated emitter-wrap-through (EWT) design [1] has a collecting emitter on front and rear side. These emitter areas are electrically connected by small holes. Due to the double-sided collecting junction, this cell design is favourable for materials with a low-minority charge carrier diffusion length leading to a higher short circuit current density.

In this work, we have investigated the relationship between electrode distance and stability of a resulting a-Si:H. The stability is improved with decreasing electrode distance. At shorter electrode distance, formation of higher silane-related-reactive species is suppressed by heating effect of gas molecules near the cathode due to a proximity to the heated anode.

585,Dependence of the recombination in thin-film Si solar cells grown by ion-assisted deposition on the crystallographic orientation of the substrate,"One promising strategy for achieving high-quality polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass is based on low-temperature ion-assisted deposition for epitaxial thickening of a thin, large-grained seeding layer on glass. The crystal growth on the seeding layer is influenced by various factors, amongst which the crystal orientation of the grains plays a substantial role. In this paper we investigate how the electronic properties of solar cells grown on “ideal” seeding layers (Si wafers) are influenced by the crystallographic orientation of the substrate. The Si wafers are heavily doped p-type, ensuring that their contribution to the photogenerated current is small. The films grown on (100)-oriented Si substrates have a very low density of structural defects, while the films grown on (111)-oriented Si substrates display a high density of twin defects. The electronic properties of the thin-film solar cells were investigated by means of open-circuit voltage measurements as a function of the incident light intensity. The (100)-oriented diodes consistently exhibit a higher Voc than the (111)-oriented diodes throughout the entire illumination range from 10−3 to 103Suns. We determine 7μm as the bulk minority carrier diffusion length of the as-grown (100)-oriented Si film. A lower bound of 3μm was found for the bulk minority carrier diffusion length in the as-grown (111)-oriented Si film. The performances of both types of solar cells were improved by hydrogenation in an ammonia plasma. At voltages around the 1-Sun maximum power point the improvement is due to a reduction of non-ideal current mechanisms. The diffusion length of the (100) diode remains unaffected by hydrogenation while the lower bound of the diffusion length of the (111) diode improves to 10μm.","D Neuhaus, A Aberle, A Sproul, R Bardos, S Oelting, N.-P Harder, P Widenborg","['Pacific Solar Pty Ltd, Sydney, Australia', 'ANTEC Solar GmbH, Rudisleben, Germany', 'Centre of Photovoltaic Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia']",2002,The electronic properties of solar cells grown on “ideal” seeding layers are influenced by the crystallographic orientation of the substrate.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['AU', 'DE']","['DEU', 'AUS']","['Pacific Solar Pty Ltd', 'ANTEC Solar GmbH', 'University of New South Wales']",2,"['(Pacific Solar Pty Ltd, 1)', '(ANTEC Solar GmbH, 1)', '(University of New South Wales, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

588,Influence of hydrogen passivation on majority and minority charge carrier mobilities in ribbon silicon,"Multicrystalline silicon materials and ribbons in particular contain a higher amount of defects as compared to monocrystalline silicon, which have to be passivated during solar cell processing in order to reach satisfactory cell efficiencies. Within the solar cell process, this is usually carried out via the deposition of a hydrogen-rich SiNx layer and a following firing step. During passivation, the electronic properties of the materials (conductivity, mobility) can change which might have an influence on the optimised parameters like emitter sheet resistance and grid geometry. This paper deals with the impact of hydrogen passivation on the electronic properties of majority and minority charge carriers in ribbon silicon materials. Majority charge carrier mobilities resulting from Hall measurements are strongly increasing after hydrogenation especially at temperatures below 300K. Even at room temperature, changes in mobility up to a factor of 2 have been observed. For the determination of minority charge carrier mobilities in processed solar cells, a new method is presented based on spatially resolved internal quantum efficiency and lifetime measurements. It allows the calculation of mapped mobilities especially in materials showing small diffusion lengths.

If the surface is not well passivated, a large amount of recombination occurs in such regions. This type of recombination is influenced by the electrostatics of both the p–n junction and the surface, and hence it is different from the commonly described recombination phenomena occurring in the p–n junction within the bulk. We developed a two-dimensional model for the recombination mechanisms occurring in emitter p–n junctions bordering on surfaces. The model is validated by reproducing the experimental I–V curves of specially designed silicon solar cells. It is shown under which circumstances a poor surface passivation, near where the p–n junction borders on the surface, reduces the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage.

After the growth of GaAs buffer layer, multi-stacked InAs QDs were grown by self-assembly with a slow growth rate of 0.01ML/s, which provides high dot quality and large dot size. Then, the structure was capped with n-GaAs and wide band gap n-GaAlAs was introduced. One, two or three stacks of QDs were sandwiched in the p–n heterojunction. The contribution of QDs in solar cell hetero-structure is the quantized nature and a high density of quantized states.

In the determination, it is often assumed that series resistance Rs is small and the shunt resistance Rsh very large, their effects can be neglected. The resultant dynamic resistance can be called the external dynamic resistance RD. RD is normally taken to be the slope of the IV characteristic of a cell or a module. We present in this paper a new method to determine an internal dynamic resistance Rd of a photovoltaic module based on one illuminated IV curve, taken into account finite series and shunt resistance. In the experiment, we measure illuminated and dark characteristics of a 4.5Wp commercial X-Si solar module (9V, 500mA) at 25–27°C, and calculate Rd and RD.

640,Determination of photo-active region in organic thin film solar cells with an organic heterojunction,"The photo-active region in the solar cells consisting of Cu-phthalocyanine (CuPc) and perylene-derivative (PV) layers was determined by using exciton blocking layers (EBLs) inserted in these layers. The photocurrent density was low when the EBL was placed near the CuPc/PV interface. With the increase of the distance between the EBL and the CuPc/PV interface, the photocurrent increased. However, when the distance reached a certain value, it leveled off owing to the limited diffusion length of excitons. From the analysis of the relationship between the position of EBL and the photocurrent density, the photo-active regions in the CuPc and PV layers were estimated to be 8 and 12nm thick from the interface, respectively.","Michio Matsumura, Tadayoshi Matsumura, Yoshihiko Matsui, Takahiro Osasa","['Research Center for Solar Energy Chemistry, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Japan']",2006,The photo-active region in the solar cells consisting of Si-phthalocyanine and perylene-derivative layers was determined by using exciton blocking layers inserted in these layers.,[],[],[],[],['heterojunction'],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['Osaka University'],0,"['(Osaka University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
641,p-doped μc-Si:H window layers prepared by hot-wire CVD for amorphous solar cell application,"We report on boron-doped μc-Si:H films prepared by hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) using silane as a source gas and trimethylboron (TMB) as a dopant gas and their incorporation into all-HW amorphous silicon solar cells. The dark conductivity of these films was in the range of 1–10(Ωcm)−1. The open circuit voltage Voc of the solar cells was found to decrease from 840mV at low hydrogen dilution H-dil=91% to 770mV at high H-dil =97% during p-layer deposition which can be attributed to the increased crystallinity at higher H-dil and to subsequent band edge discontinuity between μc-Si:H p- and amorphous i-layer. The short circuit current density Jsc and the fill factor FF show an optimum at an intermediate H-dil and decrease for the highest H-dil. To improve the conversion efficiency and the reproducibility of the solar cells, an amorphous-like seed layer was incorporated between TCO and the bulk p-layer. The results obtained until now for amorphous solar cells with and without the seed layer are presented. The I–V parameters for the best p–i–n solar cell obtained so far are Jsc=13.95mA/cm2, Voc=834mV, FF=65% and η=7.6%, where the p-layers were prepared with 2% TMB.

Indium oxide doped with molybdenum (IMO), prepared by the hollow cathode sputtering technique, exhibits high charge-carrier mobility up to 80cm2/Vs. No free-carrier absorption in the near infrared region has been found in the IMO. The superior long-wavelength transparency, however, is not sufficient for thin film Si solar cell applications. To obtain the highest possible short circuit current, the TCO needs to possess additional light trapping structure. Anisotropic etching of fiber texture oriented ZnO has been shown to result in an effective light trapping structure. Here we propose a bilayer structure that consists of light trapping-intrinsic ZnO and IMO (the ZnO/IMO bilayer). Both layers show low free-carrier absorption up to the wavelength of 1200nm.

655,A study of a two stage maximum power point tracking control of a photovoltaic system under partially shaded insolation conditions,"A photovoltaic (PV) array shows relatively low output power density, and has a greatly drooping current–voltage (I–V) characteristic. Therefore, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control is used to maximize the output power of the PV array. Many papers have been reported in relation to MPPT. However, the current–power (I–P) curve sometimes shows multi-local maximum point mode under non-uniform insolation conditions. The operating point of the PV system tends to converge to a local maximum output point which is not the real maximal output point on the I–P curve. Some papers have been also reported, trying to avoid this difficulty. However, most of those control systems become rather complicated. Then, the two stage MPPT control method is proposed in this paper to realize a relatively simple control system which can track the real maximum power point even under non-uniform insolation conditions.

660,Role of hydrazine monohydrate during texturization of large-area crystalline silicon solar cell fabrication,"Reduction of optical losses in monocrystalline silicon solar cells by surface texturing is one of the important issues of modern silicon photovoltaic. For texturization during commercial monocrystalline silicon solar cell fabrication, a mixture of NaOH or KOH and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is generally used in order to achieve good uniformity of pyramidal structure on the silicon surface. The interfacial energy between silicon and electrolyte should be reduced in order to achieve sufficient wettability for the silicon surface which in turn will enhance the pyramid nucleation. In this work, we have investigated the role of hydrazine monohydrate as a surface-active additive, which supplies OH− ions after dissociation. This cuts down the IPA consumption during texturing without any loss of uniformity of textured pyramid. We are probably the first group to report such a novel idea of using hydrazine monohydrate addition in NaOH solution for texturization of solar cell.

As a result, the maximum efficiency of 9.13% has been achieved at an i-layer deposition rate of 2.3nm/s. We attribute the improved performance of high-pressure-grown μc-Si:H solar cells to the structural evolution toward denser grain arrangement that prevents post-oxidation of grain boundaries.","Takuya Matsui, Akihisa Matsuda, Michio Kondo","['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan']",2006,A high-rate plasma process based on high-pressure and silane-depletion glow discharge for highly efficient microcrystalline silicon p–i–n junction solar cells.,[],[],[],[],"['n junction', 'junction solar', 'junction']",[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology'],1,"['(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

Based on the results of analysis, under expected carbon tax, PV needs subsidy for a while even if we consider both avoided cost and Green Credit. For attaining the target in 2010, PV needs more expensive buyback than that at present. After 2010 necessary subsidy decreases gradually and it becomes unnecessary in 2030.

663,PV solar electricity industry: Market growth and perspective,"The photovoltaic (PV) solar electricity market has shown an impressive 33% growth per year since 1997 until today with market support programs as the main driving force. The rationales for this development and the future projections towards a 100 billion € industry in the 2020s, by then only driven by serving cost-competitively customer needs are described. The PV market, likely to have reached about 600MW in the year 2003, is discussed according to its four major segments: consumer applications, remote industrial electrification, developing countries, and grid-connected systems. While in the past, consumer products and remote industrial applications used to be the main cause for turnover in PV, in recent years the driving forces are more pronounced in the grid-connected systems and by installations in developing countries. Examples illustrating the clear advantage of systems using PV over conventional systems based, e.g., on diesel generators in the rural and remote electrification sector are discussed. For the promotion of rural electrification combined with the creation of local business and employment, suitable measures are proposed in the context of the PV product value chain. The competitiveness of grid-connected systems is addressed, where electricity generating costs for PV are projected to start to compete with conventional utility peak power quite early between 2010 and 2020 if time-dependent electricity tariffs different for bulk and peak power are assumed. The most effective current-pulling force for grid-connected systems is found to be the German Renewable Energy (EEG) Feed-in Law where the customers are focusing on yield, performance, and long-life availability. The future growth in the above-defined four market segments are discussed and the importance of industry political actions in order to stimulate the markets either in grid-connected systems by feed-in tariff programs as well as for off-grid rural developing country applications by long-term financing schemes are pointed out. A technology roadmap is presented with special emphasis on the fact that different customer needs are best served with best-adopted technologies and not vice versa. The need for the third generation PV technologies, implying that so called first (c-Si-wafer)- and second (thin-film)- generation PV technologies will be overcome in a short to medium time scale, is obsolete; in contrast, the excellent scientific ideas developed within ‘Third generation’ concepts—like utilization of hot electrons, quantum wells and nanostructures—are shown to be part of ‘New Technologies’ opening new product ideas and additional market segments. The rationale for decreasing cost by increasing productivity for all technologies as well as the interpretation of price learning curves is presented. The role of PV in the future global energy supply chain is lined out. Due to a fast growing market driven by increasing widespread acceptance of PV, a substantial PV business and creation of employment in coming decades is expected. This in turn can provide solutions for nowadays global issues, such as a global energy justice by providing environmentally benign power to billions of people, who otherwise will lack energy solutions severely.",Winfried Hoffmann,"['RWE SCHOTT Solar GmbH, Alzenau, Germany']",2006,"The photovoltaic solar electricity market has shown an impressive growth per year since 1997 until today with market support programs as the main driving force.

It was found that the highest efficiency of the cell could be achieved at SiO2 layer thickness of around 20Å. The efficiency of the cells decreases as the surface states density Qss becomes higher. Moreover, the efficiency increases as the electron concentration of ZnO layer is increased due to the decrease of work function of ZnO. It was also found that the lower transmittance of the high carrier concentration ZnO due to the free-carrier absorption at infrared wavelength region does not give any significant effect to the cell performance.

These films had lowe absorption coefficients than conventional a-SiO due to larger oxygen contents and microcrystalline phase, but their conductivities were still high since they contained some microcrystalline Si phase. Furthermore, it was found that it is easier to make microcrystalline a-SiO than a-SiC films at low substrate temperature. By applying these films to the p-layer of metal/nip/ITO type cells, higher performance was obtained, compared to the cells with conventional microcrystalline Si p-layer deposited at lower temperature and conventional a-SiO p-layer.

The most recent BCSC structure, where the emphasis is on simplicity and low cost, has the number of high temperature processing steps reduced to one, while efficiencies in the vicinity of those achieved by the conventional BCSC are anticipated.

We have employed the differences in the re-equilibration behaviour that have been observed in various intrinsic materials when the Fermi-level is shifted towards the valence band edge, in order to design a cell with a new profiled i-layer which would possess an improved electric field distribution after light soaking compared to cells with a constant i-layer. The contribution of the interface region to the stabilized conversion efficiency is greatly improved, whereas the first 50 nm of the cell structure remain unchanged.

747,Surface microstructure of CIS thin films produced by rapid thermal processing,"The surfaces of polycrystalline CuInSe2 thin films produced by rapid thermal processing (RTP) have been analyzed by scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy in ambient air. Deviating from standard measurement techniques the tunnelling microscope is driven by an AC sample voltage for surface morphology mapping in the constant current mode. Additionally, a Fermi energy mapping of the semiconductor surface is performed by mapping significant features of the I–V tunnelling characteristic. The polarity of the tunnelling current proves to be a reliable measure of the conductivity type of the material (n- or p-type); the observation of leakage currents at small bias voltages allows the identification of gap states around the Fermi level or metallic phases. Current-voltage curves taken at positions of different conduction type verigy the spectroscopic information in the maps. Typical areas imaged are (1.5 μm)2. Intra- and inter-granular nonuniformities of the conduction type are observed. Although the bulk material of all samples investigated is p-conductive, abrupt changes of the conductivity type of the surfaces from p- to n-type are observed as a function of the overall copper-to-indium ratio. The dominant current flow direction in slightly Cu-rich thin film bulk material is associated with p-type conduction, whereas In-rich samples exhibit largely n-type conductivity at the surface.

A band model has been used to evaluate the charge carrier transport parameters and the generation of charge carriers is explained on the basis of an exciton model which is confirmed by the intensity variation of the photocurrent in these dyes. The dyes were found to behave as p-type semiconductors. The distribution of traps which is exponential in nature is suggested from the intensity dependence of the short-circuit current for photovoltaic properties. The results were sought to rationalise in terms of the structure of the dyes with their conduction properties.," Varadarajan, L Patnaik, M Mohanty, B Pattanaik, H Yadav","['Department of Chemical Technology, Matunga, India', 'Centre for Advanced Studies, University', 'Department of Chemistry, Ravenshaw College, Cuttack, India']",1994,The present results are concerned with the photoconduction and photovoltaic behaviour of two new merocyanine dyes in thin film form on a surface type multi-electrode cell structure.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['IN'],['IND'],"['University of Mumbai', 'University', 'Ravenshaw College']",0,"['(University of Mumbai, 0)', '(University, 0)', '(Ravenshaw College, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Sustainability Practices in Solar Energy', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy']"
808,CdS-CdTe anisotropic nanocomposites as photovoltaic substance,"Anomalous photovoltaic effects in nanometre-scale composites formed by simultaneous oblique sputter deposition of CdTe and CdS from different directions have been studied. The resultant thin film shows an anomalous photovoltage as high as 150 V / cm along the substrate plane which is parallel to a straight line linked between CdS and CdTe targets under 720 W / m2 AM-2 irradiation. This film has a composition distribution along the substrate plane. The consistent relation between photovoltaic properties and film composition has been observed, that is, as the ratio of CdS component in the film increases, the film resistance decreases. The response speed of photovoltages is faster than that of single-phase CdTe film. It has been found that the CdS-CdTe composites films formed by the above method are photoconductive and a dominant factor of photoconduction is due to the CdS component in the composites.","Naohiko Kato, Tatsumi Hioki, Shoji Noda, Tomoyosi Motohiro","['Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories Inc, Aichi-ken, Japan']",1994,Anomalous photovoltaic effects in nanometre-scale composites formed by simultaneous sputter oblique deposition of AlGa and AlAl from different directions have been studied.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories Inc'],1,"['(Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories Inc, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

811,Fabrication of thin film silicon solar cells on plastic substrate by very high frequency PECVD,"The paper describes the way to transfer process technology of state-of-the-art high efficiency thin film silicon solar cells fabrication on cheap plastic (such as PET or PEN) substrates, by two completely different approaches: (i) by transfer process (Helianthos concept) of thin film silicon cells deposited at high substrate temperature, Ts (∼200°C) and (ii) direct deposition on temperature sensitive substrates at low Ts (∼100°C). Adaptation of the process parameters and cell processing to the requirement of the flexible/plastic substrate is the most crucial step. In-situ diagnosis of the plasma has been done to understand the effect of inter-electrode distance, substrate temperature and hydrogen dilution on the gas phase conditions. Whereas, for the transfer process, the inter-electrode distance is a critical deposition condition that needs to be adapted for the flexible substrates, the direct deposition on plastic substrates has an added issue of loss in material quality and the deposition rate due to depositions at low Ts. Our studies indicate that ion energy is crucial for obtaining compact films at low temperature and high hydrogen dilution helps to compensate the loss of ion energy at low substrate temperatures. Efficiencies of ∼5.9% and 6.2% have been obtained for n–i–p type a-Si cells on PET and PEN substrates, respectively, using direct deposition. Using an adapted inter-electrode distance, an a-Si/nc-Si tandem cell on plastic (polyester) substrate with an efficiency of 8.1% has been made by Helianthos cell transfer process.","Y Liu, M Brinza, A Borreman, J Rath, R Schropp","['Faculty of Science, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands', 'Nuon Company, The Netherlands', 'Helianthos b.v']",2010,"The paper describes the way to transfer process technology of state-of-the-art high efficiency thin film silicon solar cells fabrication on cheap plastic substrates, by two completely different approaches: by transfer process of thin film silicon cells deposited at high substrate temperature, Ts and direct deposition on temperature sensitive substrates at low Ts .",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['NL'],['NLD'],"['Utrecht University', 'Nuon Company', 'Helianthos b.v']",2,"['(Utrecht University, 0)', '(Nuon Company, 1)', '(Helianthos b.v, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

The dependence of cell parameters on intensity has been investigated for a fairly wide illumination intensity range 15–180mW/cm2 of AM1.5 solar radiations by dividing this intensity range into a desirable number of small intensity ranges for measurements of the slopes of the I–V curves at short circuit and open circuit conditions. Initially Rsh increases slightly with Pin and then becomes constant at higher Pin values. However, Rs, n and I0 all decrease continuously with Pin, but the rate of decrease of each of these becomes smaller at higher Pin values.

822,Insights gained from computer modeling of heterojunction with instrinsic thin layer “HIT” solar cells,"The detailed electrical–optical simulator ASDMP is used to model the measured output characteristics of heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer “HIT” cells on P- and N-type c-Si substrates. The parameters extracted from modeling are used to understand the relative performances of the two types of HIT structures, with particular emphasis on the defect states on the surface of the c-Si wafer (Nss), the minority carrier lifetime in the c-Si absorber, the recombination speeds at the contacts and the band discontinuities at the amorphous/crystalline interface. Except, where the band discontinuities are varied, we apportion one-third of the band offset to the conduction band and two-thirds to the valence band. We find that Nss on the front surface (facing the incoming light) of the P-c-Si wafer strongly influence the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and to some extent the fill factor (FF), while those on the rear face reduce mainly the current and FF in P-c-Si HIT cells. In N-c-Si HIT cells, the defect density on the front face of the c-Si wafer strongly affects cell performance, those on the rear face having little influence. The lifetime of the minority carriers in the c-Si wafer, also has some influence on cell performance. However, the surface recombination speeds (SRS) of the contacts have little influence down to 103cm/s, except for the SRS of the holes at the contact that is the hole-collector. The amorphous/crystalline (a–c) valence band offset is influential in all cases; and in particular leads to S-shaped characteristics in N–c-Si HIT, except when this offset is reduced by a lower P-a-Si:H band gap or tunneling of holes takes place. Finally unlike N-type HIT, the transition from front to double HIT on P-c-Si, does not appreciably improve the solar cell output.","M Rahmouni, M Nath, A Datta, P Chatterjee, R Boubekri, P Roca I Cabarrocas","['USTO, Oran, Algeria', 'CNRS, Palaiseau, France', 'Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata, India']",2010,A method of improving the output of a solar cell having intrinsic thin layer cells on a first type of substrate and an intrinsic thin layer cell on a second type of substrate.,[],[],[],[],['heterojunction'],"['hit', 'hit solar', 'layer hit']",[],"['FR', 'IN', 'DZ']","['DZA', 'FRA', 'IND']","['University of Science and Technology Oran', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique', 'Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science']",0,"['(University of Science and Technology Oran, 0)', '(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 0)', '(Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, 0)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

A numerical simulation has been performed using AMPS-1D simulator to explore the possibility of higher efficiency and stable CdS/CdTe cell among several cell structures with indium tin oxide (ITO) and cadmium stannate (Cd2SnO4) as front contact material, tin oxide (SnO2), zinc oxide (ZnO) and zinc stannate (Zn2SnO4) as buffer layer, and silver (Ag) or antimony telluride (Sb2Te3) with molybdenum (Mo) or zinc telluride (ZnTe) with aluminium (Al) as back contact material. The cell structure ITO/i-ZnO/CdS/CdSxTe1−x/CdTe/Ag has shown the best conversion efficiency of 16.9% (Voc=0.9V, Jsc=26.35mA/cm2, FF=0.783). This analysis has shown that ITO as front contact material, ZnO as buffer layer and ZnTe or Sb2Te3 back surface reflector (BSR) are suitable material system for high efficiency (>15%) and stable CdS/CdTe cells.

827,Towards solar grade silicon: Challenges and benefits for low cost photovoltaics,"It is well known that silicon in its various structural configurations (single crystal, multicrystalline, amorphous, micro-nanocrystalline) supplies almost 90% of the substrates used in the photovoltaic industry. It is also known, since years, that the photovoltaic (PV) industry shows a marked growth trend, which demanded and demands a continuous, huge increase of the bulk silicon supply in the order of 30%/yr. In order to fulfill their today- and future needs, many companies worldwide took the decision to start the installation of many thousand tons/year plants, most of them using the Siemens process, some of them using the MG route, to produce the so called solar grade (SG) silicon. The advantages of the Siemens process are well known, as it provides ultrapure silicon, directly usable for growing either single crystalline Czochralski ingots or multicrystalline ingots using the directional solidification (DS) technique. The disadvantages are its high energetic cost (a minimum of 120kWH/kg) and the possible losses of chlorinated gases in the atmosphere, with possible severe environmental problems. The advantages of the MG route are still potential, as there is no commercially available production of solar silicon as yet, and rely on its reduced energetic costs (a maximum of 25–30kWh/kg) for a feedstock directly usable for growing multicrystalline ingots using the DS technique. The drawbacks of silicon of MG origin are its larger concentration of metallic impurities, as compared with the Siemens one, the higher B and P content, and the potentially high carbon content. The aim of this paper is to deal with some of the problems encountered so far with the silicon of MG origin with respect to the metallic and non-metallic impurities content, as well as to propose technologically feasible solar grade feedstock specifications.",Sergio Pizzini,"['Ned Silicon Spa, Osimo, Italy']",2010,The invention relates to a method for the production of solar grade silicon using the directional solidification technique.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['IT'],['ITA'],['Ned Silicon Spa'],1,"['(Ned Silicon Spa, 1)']",1,"['Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems']"
828,Modelling of hot carrier solar cell absorbers,"Hot Carrier cells aim to tackle the carrier thermalisation loss after absorption of above band gap photons by separating and collecting carriers before they thermalise. Such slowing of carrier cooling may be achieved by modulation of the phonon decay mechanisms in nanostructures. 3D force constant modelling of quantum dot nanostructures indicates that complete mini-gaps in the phonon dispersion can be achieved across reciprocal space for very small (1nm) close packed quantum dots with a large mass difference between quantum dot (QD) and matrix. This work uses force constants from the literature for bulk materials. A 3D model using the more accurate ab-initio calculation of force constants indicates that only very small mini-gaps in reciprocal space exist for larger quantum dots with a small mass difference, although thus far the model has not been able to simulate these small, high mass difference, closely packed QD systems. For such small QD systems it is indicated that if correctly engineered the mini-gaps could prevent the major Klemens’-type decay mechanism of a longitudinal/transverse optical (LTO) phonon decaying to two longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons of half the energy and equal and opposite momenta. As this is the primary decay mechanism of non-equilibrium ‘hot’ phonons emitted by hot electrons, its prevention can create a ‘hot phonon bottleneck’ which will re-heat the electron gas and thus slow the rate of carrier cooling.","Robert Patterson, Gavin Conibeer, Jean-Francois Guillemoles, Santosh Shrestha, Martin Green, Lunmei Huang","['ARC Photovoltaics Centre of Excellence, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia', 'France']",2010,The slowing of carrier cooling may be achieved by modulation of the phonon decay mechanisms in nanostructures.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['AU', 'FR']","['FRA', 'AUS']",['University of New South Wales'],0,"['(University of New South Wales, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

Metal nanoparticles support surface plasmon modes, which are used to couple light into the underlying optical modes of the semiconductor.

In addition to lifetime, we present defect luminescence spectra measured by photoluminescence spectroscopy, including an interpretation of the origin of a remarkably temperature stable emission line at 838meV.

850,Integrated high-concentration PV near-term alternative for low-cost large-scale solar electric power,"Large-scale photovoltaic electric power generation deployment and utilization is no longer dictated by limitations in technology, but rather by the economics of PV systems vs. other renewable or traditional options. This paper describes a near-term alternative option for cost-effective solar electric power generation based on a novel sunlight concentrating technology: integrated high-concentration PV(IHCPV). The advantages of high-concentration systems have been well analyzed, but development was constrained by the lack of solar cell capable of withstanding the rigors of concentrated sunlight. The development of a stable, high-concentration back-junction, point-contact cell, by Amonix, paved the way for high-concentration system development.

852,Site dependence of the energy collection of PV modules,"Today, solar cells and modules are optimised and rated with respect to standard test conditions (STC), i.e. for an irradiation of 1000 W/m2, a module temperature of 25°C and the standard spectrum AM 1.5. However, these conditions do not correspond to real operating conditions of Photovoltaics: In Freiburg, Germany, 50% of the total irradiation is in the interval below 600 W/m2, but in Sudan, Africa, this amounts to 20% only. Module temperatures vary between −20°C and 80°C, light incidence angles between 0° and 90°. As a consequence, the performance of PV modules under real conditions can be up to 30% (on a monthly scale) lower than at STC, depending on the weather and the module/cell design. Means to derive a rating of outdoor performance from indoor module measurements will be presented, and the variation of the module performance ratio with yearly or monthly irradiation sums and average temperatures is given.

The grains of CBD-CdS are more compact and smooth than those of HVE-CdS. The annealing and CdCl2 treatment cause grain growth, which is stronger for the CdCl2 treated samples. The grain-size of the as-deposited CdTe on CBD-CdS is about 5 times larger than of those grown on HVE-CdS. The structural and electrical properties of CdTe/CdS solar cells are strongly dependent on the CdS. The grain size of CdCl2 treated CdTe layers are similar, irrespective of the transparent conducting oxide substrate and CdS deposition method. The efficiency of solar cells on thin CBD-CdS is low (about 5.6%) because of pin-holes and a large intermixing of CdTe-CdS.

For film deposition in the Ts range 150°C<Ts⩽250°C, XRD shows that coexistence of the 〈100〉 and 〈111〉 textures. The resistivity and Hall mobility of ITO films were improved due to thermally induced crystallization. However, carrier concentration of these ITO films is sensitive to the Ts.

959,Adjusting optical resonance thickness to increase the conversion efficiency of polymer solar cells,"The derivatives of C60, [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and 3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) were dissolved in DCB solvent, then spin coated into an active layer for polymer solar cells. The experimental parameters were studied carefully to obtain the optimum power conversion efficiency (PCE). The primary process for generation of photocurrent in an organic photovoltaic device is the generation of bound electron–hole pairs (excitons) by absorption of energy (photons) from the optical electric field. Modeling was based on the assumption that the photocurrent generation process is the result of the creation and diffusion of photogenerated species (excitons), which are dissociated by charge transfer at the active layer. Improve organic optics absorb by insert organic layer (CuPc or C60) at the active layer/Al interface. This research is divided into two components. First part, we use n-type C60 as transmission layer. When an optimum thickness of C60 is 5nm, the Jsc of polymer solar cell can be increased from 7.26mA/cm2 to 7.7mA/cm2. The Voc decrease is because the energy level of C60 LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) at 4.5eV is higher than the 3.7eV of PCBM. Second part, we use p-type CuPc as transmission layer. When an optimum thickness of CuPc is 3nm, the short circuit photo-current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) of polymer solar cell can be increased from 7.26mA/cm2 to 8.0mA/cm2 and 0.56–0.58V, respectively. The reason is the same as C60. The Voc increase is because the energy level of CuPc LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) at 3.1eV is lower than the 3.7eV of PCBM. The Jsc increase is because the 3nm of CuPc leads to a constructive interference happened in the active layer and thus optical absorption increases. In this study we used 3nm of CuPc at the active layer/Al interface to enhance the short circuit current density, and the efficiency was increased to 2.94%.","Yu Tsai, Fuh-Shyang Juang, Wei-Ping Chu, Mark Liu, Po-Hsun Wang, Ming-Hua Chung, Chin-Ming Chen, Jian-Shian Lin","['Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan 300, ROC', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka Suita, Japan', 'Institute of Electro-Optical and Materials Science, National Formosa University, Huwei, Taiwan, ROC', 'Department of Material Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan ROC', 'Mechanical and System Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, HsinChu, Taiwan 310, ROC']",2010,"The derivatives of C60, -phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester , and 2-hexylthiophene were dissolved in COO solvent, then spin coated into an active layer for polymer solar cells.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['JP', 'TW']","['JPN', 'TWN']","['Industrial Technology Research Institute', 'Osaka University', 'National Formosa University', 'National Chiao Tung University', 'Industrial Technology Research Institute']",2,"['(Industrial Technology Research Institute, 1)', '(Osaka University, 0)', '(National Formosa University, 0)', '(National Chiao Tung University, 0)', '(Industrial Technology Research Institute, 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

968,"Vacuum evaporation of CdTe thin films on Ni, Mo, Ti and TiN-deposited sapphire single-crystal substrates","Cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin films were grown on sapphire c-face single-crystal substrates by vacuum evaporation. Prior to growing the CdTe thin films, conducting thin films of Ni, Mo, Ti and titanium nitride (TiN) were grown on the sapphire substrates. The crystallinities and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the CdTe thin films grown on the various conducting thin films were investigated and they were compared with those of CdTe thin films grown directly on sapphire substrates without a conducting thin film. CdTe thin films with relatively high crystallinities were obtained when Ti and TiN were used as the conducting thin film. Therefore, the PL properties of the CdTe thin films on such conducting thin films were not inferior to those of the CdTe thin film grown directly on the sapphire substrate. The effect of the Cd and Te supply ratio on the properties of the CdTe thin films was also investigated.

969,Nano-scale current voltage characteristics of thin film solar cell with light irradiations,"Nano-scale current voltage (I–V) characteristics of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells were studied with and without light irradiations by using conductive Atomic Force Microscope (conductive-AFM). To obtain proper I–V characteristics, electrical contacts between the n-layer of the a-Si solar cells and the cantilever of the AFM were modified by depositing ZnO films with the thickness of 20nm on the tip using DC sputterer. The I–V characteristics were changed from Schottky like to ohmic like. Surface defects and grain boundaries of the ZnO thin film possibly formed an ohmic-like current path between n-layer and the tip of the cantilever. We measured photo-current map at the bias of −2V with a resolution of nano-meter scales. High photo-current paths appeared at nano-crystallites formed in the nc-Si:H film of the solar cell while small current area was observed at the boundaries of the small and large grains. This suggests that the boundaries have high impedance created by hydrogen passivation or act as a leakage current path for the photo-current recombination. These results imply that our proposed measurement technique using conductive-AFM combined with covering of ZnO film on the cantilever is a useful tool for the evaluation of the short path of the photo-current.

We observed that the open-circuit voltage (Voc) depends on the bandgap of p-layer. Using wide bandgap p-layer can reduce recombination at p-layer and p/i interface. Moreover, we also have studied the effect of light intensity on the performance of hetero-junction μc-Si:H solar cells. From simulation result, it was confirmed that the Voc logarithmically increases with increasing the light intensity. Besides, we also observed that the p-layer bandgap strongly influences the light-intensity dependence of hetero-junction μc-Si:H solar cells. The enhancement of Voc (ΔVoc) with increasing light intensity improves as the bandgap of p-layer is increased.

971,Effect of pH on the characteristics of nanocrystalline ZnS thin films prepared by CBD method in acidic medium,"The structural, morphological, and optical properties of zinc sulfide (ZnS) thin films deposited using chemical bath deposition method are reported. These films were deposited on soda lime glass substrates using Na2EDTA as a complexing agent, in acidic medium at 80°C. The effect of the pH ranging from 5 to 6.5 on quality of ZnS thin films is investigated. Irrespective of the pH values used for the deposition all films are polycrystalline with a wurtzite (hexagonal) structure. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) characterization shows that the surface of the sample deposited with pH 5 and 5.5 is compact and uniform. However, agglomerated clusters (∼100nm) are observed in ZnS thin films grown with pH above 6. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results shows the presence of only Zn–S bonding for the ZnS thin film grown at pH=5 while those films deposited with pH>5.5, Zn–OH as well as Zn–S bonding have been observed. The composition is almost stoichiometric for a wide range of pH values of the solution (5–6.5). The transmission spectrum of ZnS thin films having thickness from 30 to 220nm indicates a good transmission characteristic with an average transmittance of 70–85%.

The related researches have been conducted so far for the improvement of the efficiency. However, the adsorption process usually takes 24h and it may actually be responsible for deteriorative overall productivity. Therefore, in this study, we tried to investigate the optimal dye-adsorption time by analyzing the photovoltaic performance and the electrochemical impedance. If the adsorption time was insufficient, it was not enough for dye to adsorb on TiO2. And the current was increased with the increase in the adsorption time. However, the increase stopped after dye molecules covered with whole TiO2 surface. DSCs were fabricated under identical condition except for the adsorption time from 1 to 24h. The change in the outputs of DSCs was verified by the I–V characteristic curves and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As a result, the output was proportion to the adsorption time before sufficient adsorption and the performance was saturated after that.

Moreover, a trend in the grain size and surface roughness can be observed. Single broad peaks centered around 1.64eV are observed in the PL spectra of the CGS samples.

The impact of radio frequency bias power and duty ratio on a refractive index is detailed by using an ion energy analysis system. A decrease in the duty ratio resulted in a decrease in the refractive index at all powers but 60W. As duty ratio is varied at lower powers, the refractive index strongly depended on Eh/El. Another strong, but negative correlation was noted at high powers. An increase in the bias power in the range of 60–100W led to a decrease in the refractive index at all duty ratios.

987,Efficiency enhancement in polymer optoelectronic devices by introducing titanium sub-oxide layer,"We have demonstrated an efficiency enhancement in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs) by introducing solution-based titanium oxide (TiOx) layer between the polymer and Al electrode as an electron transport/injection layer. For the PLED case, the TiOx layer reduces the barrier height between the polymer and Al cathode, thereby facilitating the electron injection and enhancing the device performance. For the PSCs case, the TiOx layer plays a role as an optical spacer in PSCs leading an increase in absorption of photon in active layer by modifying the spatial distribution of the light intensity inside the device, thereby creating more photogenerated charge carriers in the bulk heterojunction layer.","Kwanghee Lee, Sun Kim, Sung Park","['Heeger Center for Advanced Materials, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea']",2010,The efficiency enhancement in polymer light-emitting diodes and polymer solar cells is achieved by introducing solution-based titanium oxide layer between the polymer and an electrode as an electron transport/injection layer.,[],[],[],"['titanium', 'titanium oxide', 'solution-based titanium']",[],[],[],['KR'],['KOR'],"['Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology', 'Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology']",0,"['(Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, 0)', '(Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
988,Improving the delamination resistance of indium tin oxide (ITO) coatings on polymeric substrates by O2 plasma surface treatment,"This work presents the effect of O2 plasma surface treatment of polymeric substrates on improving the mechanical reliability; particularly, the buckling delamination resistance of ITO coating on the substrates. ITO of various thicknesses is sputter-deposited and the delamination resistance is evaluated by uniaxial tension test. The strain at initiation of the buckling delamination (εbi) due to Poisson’s contraction perpendicular to the direction of tension is used as a metric of the resistance. The test results show that εbi of ITO on treated substrate is significantly increased compared to ITO on bare PET at all thicknesses. According to contact angle measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, O2 plasma treatment increases the surface energy of PET by increasing oxygen-containing polar groups on the surface, which seems to improve the adhesion strength between ITO and PET and to make ITO more resistance to compression.","Eun-Hye Kim, Jin-Woo Park, Chan-Woo Yang","['Division of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea']",2010,"This work presents the effect of O2 plasma surface treatment of polymeric substrates on improving the mechanical reliability; particularly, the buckling delamination resistance of ITO coating on the substrates.",[],[],[],"['indium', 'indium tin', 'tin', 'tin oxide']",[],[],[],['KR'],['KOR'],['Yonsei University'],0,"['(Yonsei University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

In order to investigate the effect of the Cu to In mole ratio on the film formation, the concentrations of indium reagent were varied in the preparation of precursor solutions. The estimated optical band gaps were ∼1.54eV and ∼1.25eV for the as-deposited and the annealed CuInSe2 thin films which could be a result of quantum size effect. A tetragonal chalcopyrite structure of CuInSe2 was identified in XRD analysis. From the XRD analysis, it was found that the crystal growth of the as-deposited and the annealed films are affected by the molar concentration of indium reagents. The film deposited from a solution with 0.025M of InCl3 shows the best crystallinity. The film thickness reaches around 2.5μm after only a 7min of deposition time which will provide good throughput for thin film PV manufacturing.","Chae Kim, Jin Lee, Si Ryu, Yeol Han, Hung Chang","['School of Chemical Biological & Environmental Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, United States', 'School of Display and Chemical Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeonsan, Republic of Korea']",2010,A solution-based continuous flow microreactor method has been developed for the deposition of thin films at low temperature.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['KR', 'US']","['KOR', 'USA']","['Oregon State University', 'Yeungnam University']",0,"['(Oregon State University, 0)', '(Yeungnam University, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
990,Relation between N–H complexes and electrical properties of GaAsN determined by H implantation,"We investigated the relation between N–H complexes and the electrical properties of GaAsN, which is a potential material for fabricating super-high-efficiency multi-junction tandem solar cells. In order to separate the effect of other residual carrier such as carbon in a GaAsN film on the electrical properties, hydrogen (H) ions were implanted into GaAsN grown by chemical beam epitaxy (CBE) and then rapid thermal annealing from 250 to 650°C was carried out. Two N–H complexes related to local vibrational modes (LVMs) in GaAsN were observed at 3098 and 3125cm−1. With an increasing annealing temperature, the integrated peak intensity of the 3098cm−1 peak (I3098) decreased, while that of the 3125cm−1 peak (I3125) increased. This indicates that N–H complexes related to the 3125cm−1 peak are thermally more stable than those related to the other peak. The hole concentrations and mobilities exhibited an increasing trend until an annealing temperature of 550°C was reached. Their increases are attributed to the removal of donor-type defects. It is suggested that the N–H complexes related to the 3098cm−1 peak are electrically active, while those giving the 3125cm−1 peak are inactive.","Makoto Inagaki, Boussairi Bouzazi, Yoshio Ohshita, Katahiko Honda, Masafumi Yamaguchi, Tomohiro Tanaka, Nobuaki Kojima, Xiuxun Han, Jong-Ha Hwang, Hidetoshi Suzuki, Jong-Han Lee","['Toyota Technological Institute, Tempaku, Japan']",2010,A method for fabricating a super-high-efficiency multi-junction tandem solar cell is provided.,[],[],[],[],"['multi-junction tandem', 'multi-junction', 'super-high-efficiency multi-junction']",[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],['Toyota Technological Institute'],1,"['(Toyota Technological Institute, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

An efficiency of 21.32% (with Voc of 0.78V, Jsc of 33.5mA/cm2 and fill factor of 0.82) has been achieved with CdS based buffer layer as the reference case. It is also found that the high efficiency CIGS cells have the absorber thickness between 2μm and 3μm. It is also revealed that the optimum thickness of buffer layer is within the range of 40–50nm. From the study with different kinds of buffer layers, cells with ZnO buffer layer produce the best efficiency of 21.16% among others.

This is due to the crystallization of an a-SiC phase in the films. To resolve this problem, CO2 gas was introduced during the deposition of stoichiometric a-SiC thin films. As a result, the dark conductivity of the films annealed at either 900 or 1000°C was reduced below 10−9S/cm, since the introduction of oxygen atoms into the films prevented the a-SiC phase from crystallizing during the annealing. O-containing Si-QDSLs were prepared and the dark conductivity of the O-containing Si-QDSLs was reduced in the range of 10−6–10−7S/cm and increased with increasing the diameter of Si-QDs, suggesting that the leakage in barrier layers was suppressed and the carrier transport through Si-QDs became predominant.","Shinsuke Miyajima, Yasuyoshi Kurokawa, Shigeru Yamada, Makoto Konagai, Akira Yamada","['Department of Physical Electronics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan', 'Photovoltaics Research Center (PVREC), Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan']",2010,"The dark conductivity of a stoichiometric a-SiO thin film, which is used as barrier layers in a Si quantum dots superlattice , increased drastically after thermal annealing above 800C.",['amorphous silicon'],[],['quantum dots'],['oxygen'],[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Tokyo Institute of Technology', 'Tokyo Institute of Technology']",0,"['(Tokyo Institute of Technology, 0)', '(Tokyo Institute of Technology, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Performance of Solar Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

1008,Degradation of carrier lifetime in Cz silicon solar cells,"The lifetime degradation induced by light illumination or carrier injection which is observed in Czochralski-grown silicon (Cz-Si) leads to a significant decrease of solar cell efficiency. Thus, the reduction of this effect has a high potential for the improvement of Cz-Si solar cells. In the present work both, the analysis of the underlying defect and its technological reduction are discussed. A clear correlation of the Cz-specific metastable defect with the oxygen and boron concentration in Cz-Si has been observed. Especially, recently performed lifetime measurements on oxygen-free boron-doped p-type MCz silicon and gallium-doped oxygen-contaminated Cz-silicon, both of which show no degradation, confirm this hypothesis. While the quantitative correlation between the defect concentration and boron is linear, the increase of the defect concentration induced by the interstitial oxygen concentration is superlinear, i.e. it follows a potential law of power approximately 5. Beyond the defect analysis, two different ways to reduce the metastable defect concentration are discussed. A proper material choice by substituting or reducing one of the major components of the metastable defect can completely avoid the degradation effect. The excellent performance of oxygen-free MCz-Si and gallium-doped Cz-Si is reflected in the achieved record efficiencies of 22.7% and 22.5%, respectively. In standard boron-doped oxygen-contaminated p-type Cz-Si a strong reduction of the metastable defect concentration can be achieved by a high-temperature process step resulting in an improvement of the stable bulk lifetime by a factor of 2–4.","W Wettling, W Warta, S Rein, J Knobloch, S Glunz","['Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, Freiburg, Germany']",2001,The lifetime degradation induced by light illumination or carrier injection which is observed in Czochralski-grown silicon leads to a significant decrease of solar cell efficiency.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['DE'],['DEU'],['Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems'],1,"['(Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, 1)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

After plasma exposure, broad band peak appears in the region of 1.0–0.78eV (1.2–1.6μm), and intensity of bound exciton peak with energy of 1.093eV, which is measured and the non-irradiated silicon has been decreased. The same experiment was also performed with RF plasma and the peak appeared not only for EBEP but also for conventional RF plasma. The damage peak tends to disappear over 420°C of the substrate temperature. The damage recovery analysis has been done in relation to the annealing temperature of the substrate after the plasma exposure. Exciton peak has been increased by increasing the temperature especially at 350°C. Furthermore, plasma-induced peak intensity has been decreased at temperature higher than 500°C. Similar peak has been observed in the samples irradiated with high-energy protons. Therefore, positive ions in the plasma are thought to be the source of the damage of the silicon. The origin of the plasma-induced defect in Si is also considered.

1020,Poly-silicon films with low impurity concentration made by hot wire chemical vapour deposition,"Analyses of various impurities (O, C, W, Fe, Ni and Cr) in the poly-Si material (both in layers as well as in cell configurations) made by HWCVD have been carried out to judge the quality of this material for application in devices. SIMS analysis showed that the oxygen concentration in the bulk of a poly-Si film made at a low hydrogen dilution (Poly2) is 3×1018cm−3 and the oxygen content drops to this value within a depth of only 50nm from the surface. On the other hand, a poly-Si film made at a high hydrogen dilution (Poly1) has a high and homogeneous oxygen content of more than 2×1021cm−3. However, in a double-layer structure (Poly2 on top of Poly1), the oxygen content of the bottom layer (Poly1) is significantly smaller than the bare Poly1 film, though this oxygen concentration is still much higher than that in the top Poly2 layer. We attribute this behaviour to the structural difference between these two films (2000cm−1 Si–H IR vibration in low-dilution material and 2100cm−1 vibration in the high-dilution material). We propose that the oxygen penetration in Poly1 occurs by two processes: (1) oxygen incorporation during growth: (2) post-deposition oxygen intrusion. The first process occurs at a low deposition rate and is dependent on the type of growth process. The second process is due to the intrusion of water vapour into the film through the voids, which increases the conductivity of the film depending on the amount of intrusion. We have shown that our device quality compact poly-Si:H (Poly2) resists oxygen incorporation even when deposited in an oxygen-rich atmosphere.","R Schropp, J Rath, P Alkemade","['Interface Physics, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands', 'DIMES/NF, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands']",2001,The present invention relates to a compact poly-Si:O film that resists oxygen incorporation even when deposited in an oxygen-rich atmosphere.,[],[],[],"['oxygen', 'oxygen incorporation', 'resists oxygen']",[],[],[],['NL'],['NLD'],"['Utrecht University', 'Delft University of Technology']",0,"['(Utrecht University, 0)', '(Delft University of Technology, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

1030,Novel process of grain boundary metallisation on mc Si solar cells,"The electronic properties of multicrystalline silicon are heavily influenced by impurities concentrated along the grain boundaries that increase the recombination activity near the crystallite borders. Dopants can also diffuse preferentially down the grain boundaries, which leads to a low resistance path down the grain. These and other effects decrease the efficiency of multicrystalline silicon solar cells. Additionally, the efficiency is lowered by the shading of areas of silicon by metallisation lines due to the reduction of the active conversion area of the cell. We present a new way to combine the grain boundaries and the front contact grid with the aim to improve the efficiency of multicrystalline silicon solar cells. A first approach has been developed to produce multicrystalline silicon solar cells with a front contact metallisation following the grain boundaries: The different grain boundaries of a multicrystalline silicon wafer are detected by optical scanning of the wafer surface. Together with the emitter sheet resistivity this image serves as an input to calculate a net of finger lines that follow the grain boundaries wherever possible. Onto these detected grain boundaries the metallisation is performed by evaporative deposition of copper and photolithography. We report on the successful implementation of such a grid on 100×100mm2 wafers.","J Summhammer, M Radike","['Atomic Institute of the Austrian Universities, Vienna, Austria']",2001,The electronic properties of multicrystalline silicon are heavily influenced by impurities concentrated along the grain boundaries that increase the recombination activity near the crystallite borders.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['AT'],['AUT'],['Atomic Institute of the Austrian Universities'],0,"['(Atomic Institute of the Austrian Universities, 0)']",1,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"
1031,Understanding carrier trapping in multicrystalline silicon,"The physical origin of minority carrier trapping centers in multicrystalline silicon is explored in both gettered and non-gettered material. The experimental evidence suggests that there are two types of trap present. One species can be removed by gettering and is related to the presence of boron–impurity pairs or complexes. The other type is impervious to gettering and is correlated to the dislocation density. Annealing experiments reveal that the trapping centers caused by boron–impurity complexes can be dissociated, and that these trapping centers do not contribute to recombination. The effect of trapping centers on open-circuit voltage is shown to be negligible when the trap density is less than the dopant density."," Cuevas, Daniel Macdonald","['FEIT, Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems, Canberra, Australia']",2001,The physical origin of minority carrier trapping centers in multicrystalline silicon is explored in both gettered and non-gettered material.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['AU'],['AUS'],['University of Canberra'],0,"['(University of Canberra, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

1047,Optimization of front metal contact firing scheme to achieve high fill factors on screen printed silicon solar cells,"For widespread implementation of silicon PV, the module cost must be reduced by a factor of 2–4. This can be accomplished by lowering the cost of solar cell materials and processing without sacrificing cell efficiency. A combination of high throughput belt line processing, SP contacts and mc-Si material offers an opportunity for significant cost reduction. However, most cell manufacturers who use the above combination are only able to achieve fill factors in the range of 0.68–0.75 with cell efficiencies in the range of 10–14%.

Effects of evaporation temperature at which the sol is concentrated and addition of polyethelene glycol (PEG) to the sol at different concentrations on film thickness, surface morphology and solar cell performance are studied. Conversion efficiency is found to increase with PEG addition up to 40 % by weight of TiO2 and then decrease with further addition due to the development of cracks in the films. Higher conversion efficiency has been obtained with the sol concentrated at 40°C than at room temperature (30°C) after which it is found to decrease with increase in temperature due to higher degree of agglomeration caused by faster rate of evaporation.

Two models, “stripe structure” and “columnar structure”, were applied for the solar cells composed of grains. For the stripe structure of 20μm active layer, to keep the efficiency distribution within 5% for individual unit cells, the stripe width requires more than 500μm for a minority-carrier lifetime of 1×10−5s and recombination velocity at the grain boundary of 1×104cm/s. For the columnar structure of 10μm active layer, to keep the efficiency independent of grain size, the recombination velocity should be kept less than 1×103cm/s.

Due to the aqueous nature of the CBD process, oxygen and hydrogen were incorporated into the ‘ZnSe’ buffer layer mainly in the form of Zn(OH)2 as is shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) measurements leading to the nomenclature ‘Zn(Se,OH)’.

Monitoring the transparency or transmittance (%T) of dip solution as a process control parameter in the chemical bath deposition (CBD)-buffer deposition step and setting the end point of dipping the CIGS-based absorbers in the solution as the %T of 60% remarkably contribute to make our CBD-buffer deposition process more reproducible.

For the H2 plasma passivated GaAs/Si solar cell, a highest conversion efficiency of 18.3% was obtained compared with that of the as-grown cell (16.6%) due to the H passivation effects on nonradiative recombination centers, which increased the minority carrier lifetime.","G Wang, T Ogawa, M Umeno, T Jimbo, T Soga","['Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan', 'Department of Environmental Technology and Urban Planning, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan']",2001,The hydrogen plasma passivation effects of SiGe-grown SiGe solar cell on Si substrate have been studied in detail.,[],[],[],"['hydrogen plasma', 'hydrogen']",[],[],[],['JP'],['JPN'],"['Nagoya Institute of Technology', 'Nagoya Institute of Technology']",0,"['(Nagoya Institute of Technology, 0)', '(Nagoya Institute of Technology, 0)']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Power Conversion Efficiency in Solar Cells', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions']"

1214,"Control of point defects in the Cu(In,Ga)Se2film synthesized at low temperature from a Cu/In2Se3stacked precursor","Low-temperature fabrication of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) film is essential for flexible CIGS solar cells. A large-grained CIGS film was synthesized with a Se-deficient Cu/In,Ga)2Se3 stacked precursor by reacting at 500 °C in a vacuum and was then subsequently annealing in Se environment. The CIGS solar cell with the as-prepared CIGS film had a poor cell performance due to a very low Ga composition at the CIGS surface. The surface Ga composition was controlled to 0.2 by supplying In, Ga, and Se in a temperature range of 350 to 500 °C. From an analysis of the photoluminescence spectra, we found that the point defects, Se vacancy and In-in-Cu antisite, in the CIGS film were greatly reduced by annealing below 450 °C. The short-circuit current was pronouncedly increased in the CIGS cells. The open-circuit voltage depended on both the Ga composition and Cu composition at the CIGS surface. In particular, a low Cu composition at the CIGS surface was essential for the higher performance solar cells. Our results indicated that CIGSs film synthesized at high temperature must be annealed at 350 °C or below to reduce undesirable point defects.","Gwang Sun Jung, Seungtae Kim, Young Min Ko, Sun Hong Moon, Yong Woo Choi, Byung Tae Ahn","['Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea']",2016,This invention relates to a method for reducing undesirable point defects in SiGe film synthesized at high temperature.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['KR'],['KOR'],['Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology'],0,"['(Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 0)']",0,"['Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Emerging Technologies in Solar Energy']"

1216,Effect of reaction temperature and time during two-step selenization and sulfurization of Se-Coated CuGa/In precursors,"In this work, the selenization of Mo/CuGa/In/Se (Se layer thickness: 1 μm) precursors followed by sulfurization was investigated. Particular emphasis was placed on the effect of the variation of the selenization temperature and sulfurization time on the morphology and compositional depth profiles of the resulting Cu(InGa)(SeS)2 (CIGSS) absorber; in addition, the current-voltage characteristics of the corresponding devices were investigated. The selenization of the precursors was achieved by using a tube-type rapid thermal annealing system at various temperatures (500, 550, and 600 °C). Post-sulfurization of Cu(InGa)Se2 (CIGS) was performed in the same system by flowing H2S/He gas at 600 °C for different periods of time (5, 10, and 15 min). Post-sulfurization can improve the open-circuit voltage of a solar cell by attracting Ga toward the surface region of the light absorber and incorporating S into the absorber to yield quinary CIGSS compounds. In addition, the voids at the Mo/CIGS interface, produced during the selenization of the CuGa/In/Se precursors, were effectively removed after post-sulfurization. Among the process conditions explored in this study, the selenization of Mo/CuGa/In/Se at 550 °C for 7 min followed by sulfurization at 600 °C for 10 min produced the device with the best performance, providing also good material properties in terms of morphology and compositional homogeneity.","Jaseok Koo, Sunmo Kwon, Woo Kyoung Kim, Yong-Suk Roh, Seok-Jin Lee, Ki-Young Jung, William N.

1218,Nanometer-thick amorphous-SnO2layer as an oxygen barrier coated on a transparent AZO electrode,"It is necessary for transparent conducting electrodes used in dye-sensitized or perovskite solar cells to have high thermal stability which is required when TiO2 is coated on the electrode. AZO films with their low-cost and good TCO properties are unfortunately unstable above 300 °C in air because of adsorbed oxygen. In this paper, the thermal stability of AZO films is enhanced by depositing an oxygen barrier on AZO films to block the oxygen. As the barrier material, SnO2 is used due to its high heat stability, electrical conductivity, and transmittance. Moreover, when the SnO2 is grown as amorphous phase, the protective effect become greater than the crystalline phase. The thermal stability of the amorphous-SnO2/AZO films varies depending on the thickness of the amorphous SnO2 layer. Because of the outstanding oxygen blocking properties of amorphous SnO2, its optimal thickness is very thin and it results in only a slight decrease in transmittance. The sheet resistance of the amorphous-SnO2/AZO film is 5.4 Ω sq−1 after heat treatment at 500 °C for 30 min in air and the average transmittance in the visible region is 83.4%. The results show that the amorphous-SnO2/AZO films have thermal stability with excellent electrical and optical properties.","Hee Sang Lee, Seong Ihl Woo","['Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea']",2016,A transparent conducting electrode for dye-sensitized or perovskite solar cells which is coated with an oxygen barrier.,[],[],"['perovskite solar', 'dye-sensitized perovskite', 'perovskite']","['oxygen', 'oxygen barrier']",[],[],[],['KR'],['KOR'],['Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology'],0,"['(Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Academic (0))']",0,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Residential Solar Energy Solutions', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"
1219,"Ga content and thickness inhomogeneity effects on Cu(In, Ga)Se2solar modules","The fluctuation of Ga content and absorption layer thickness of Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar modules is investigated by 3-dimensional numerical simulation. The band gap of CIGS is increased by the increasing Ga content, and the residual compressive strain. Strain effect worsens the degradation of the power conversion efficiency of CIGS module in addition to Ga fluctuation. The intracell Ga fluctuation degrades the open circuit voltage due to the minimum open circuit voltage in the parallel configuration, and also affects the short circuit current due to the Ga-dependent light absorption. The intercell Ga fluctuation leads to a more significant degradation for CIGS solar module efficiency than the intracell Ga fluctuation due to the additional degradation of the fill factor. The thickness fluctuation has a small effect on open circuit voltage, but causes strong degradation of short circuit current and fill factor, which leads to a more significant degradation on power conversion efficiency than Ga fluctuation to the same fluctuation percentage. In reality, the thickness can be tightly controlled within the fluctuation of 5% or less.","Xiaobo Zhu, Chee Wee Liu, Tzu-Huan Cheng","['National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'LiveStrong Optoelectronics Co., Ltd., Taiwan, R.O.C.']",2016,The fluctuation of Si content and absorption layer thickness of AlGe2 solar modules is investigated by Pdimensional numerical simulation.,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['TW'],['TWN'],"['National Taiwan University', 'LiveStrong Optoelectronics Co., Ltd.']",2,"['(National Taiwan University, 0)', '(LiveStrong Optoelectronics Co., Ltd., 1)']",2,"['Optimization and Management of Energy Storage in PV Systems', 'Commercial Applications of Solar Energy', 'Economic Considerations for Solar Projects']"

It determines open-circuit voltage and it affects the dye adsorption capacity and charge transfer, which are closely associated with photocurrent and overall performance. TiO2 is the most proper material for nano-porous layer since the first development of DSCs. This work focuses on the enhancement of TiO2 by doping. Sulfur (S) doping enhances charge transfer and the photoconversion of TiO2. Therefore, the increase in photocurrent and efficiency is expected by S doping. S is doped into TiO2 by hydrolysis method. The amount of S is varied and their photo-responses are verified. The most effective S doped TiO2 is applied to DSCs. Overall performance of DSC is enhanced by the addition of S doped TiO2. Especially, the photocurrent is much increased by the improvement on charge transfer, electron lifetime, and photo-conversion.
